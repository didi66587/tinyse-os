The DosLynx version&nbsp;0.44b 32-bit&nbsp;Protected&nbsp;Mode variation
has been refreshed with an almost up-to-date OpenSSL library.
This brings back its ability to contact most of the Web's "secure" servers.
The DosLynx 16-bit executables are also being updated -- so you'll have a
set of software that consistently identifies itself as
version&nbsp;0.44b .<p>

These updates again make DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b the strongest running version(s)
of DosLynx, yet!<p>

<a href="http://macall.net/dlx44bin.zip">The Traditional
 DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b Package</a> contains DOSLYNX.EXE and all of its
supporting files.  This is the Real&nbsp;Mode version, recommended for all
users.  <a href="http://macall.net/dlx44bpm.zip">The 
 DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b Protected&nbsp;Mode Add-On Package</a> contains
DOSLYNXP.EXE (the 16-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode executable), DOSLYNXS.EXE
(the 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode executable), my latest
 <a href="DPMIREVU.HTM">DPMIREVU.HTM</A> document, and several other
supporting files.  It is recommended for users with systems that can provide
DPMI service.  That provision will be easy for DOSLYNXS.EXE, because those
"supporting files" include CWSDPMI.EXE, an excellent 32-bit DPMI server.
Both of these Packages consist of .ZIP files, which may be un-zipped into a
single directory without conflict.<P>

There are a couple other readme files for DosLynx.  One is the again
updated <a href="readme.htm">README.HTM</a> which still tells about the
original features, command line parameters, and other important stuff.
There also is a <a href="history.txt">history file</a> which describes
the major changes I've made in bringing DosLynx from v0.43b to v0.44b.
The history file also lists some known bugs or missing features.
If you find one that isn't there, please e-mail me at
 <a href="FCMEMADR.GIF">the address in this graphic</a>.
Finally, Wayne&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Buttles has provided a little cheat sheet
listing the <a href="keys.txt">key commands</a> to run DosLynx from the
keyboard.  It includes ones he added.  I've brought it up to date and added
a second page listing the "DosLynx Control, Movement, and Navigation Keys".
And, a third page listing the "DosLynx Keys for Selecting and Clipping".
<P>

Remember that you can navigate with your numeric key pad by putting
Num&nbsp;Lock ON.<P>

DosLynx no longer contains a built-in graphics viewer.  That has been
replaced with a swap out and call to DLXVIEW with a parameter naming
the .BMP, .GIF, .JPG, .PCX, .PNG, or .TIF file to be viewed.  You may edit
DLXVIEW.BAT to invoke your favorite viewer.  The
 <a href="http://macall.net/dlx44bin.zip">Traditional
 DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b Package</a> contains a sample DLXVIEW.BAT file which
 invokes <a href="http://hplx.pgdn.de/lxpic.zip">LXPIC</a>
 (requires CGA+).<P>

As Wayne said:
"I have enhanced DosLynx for my own personal enjoyment.  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I am just releasing my changes to the general public in hopes that it will
help some other DOS User.  I have made every attempt to keep it compatible
with the lowest IBM-Compatible computer so that the greatest number of
people can benefit and I will continue to do so as long as I play with the
code."<P>

Good luck, and happy browsing.<P>
