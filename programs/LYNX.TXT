         Thank you for your interest in the Lynx protocol!

         You have discovered a powerful communication tool that has
         lots of features in a small package.

         Lynx is a windowed batch data transmission protocol which
         utilizes proven techniques of efficiency, reliability and
         flexibility:

           * RLE data compression on a block by block basis
           * 32-bit CRC on each block for reliable error detection
           * Fast recovery from data transmission errors
           * Continuous data flow from the sender
           * Dynamic block scaling for noisy connections
           * Resume mode for recovery of crashed transmissions
           * Passing full file name, size, date and time
           * Up to 255 files may be transferred in a single batch
           * Retaining exact file size
           * Stamp received files with current or original time/date
           * CTS/RTS handshaking

         Lynx has met or exceeded the ZMODEM protocol in efficiency
         under numerous conditions.  Benchmark results are revealed in
         the section of this document entitled, "Benchmarks".

         In order for the Lynx protocol to be useful, the protocol has
         been implemented in an MS-DOS executable file, called
         LYNX.EXE, which is included in this package.  With this
         program, you can perform data transfers over a dial-up modem
         line, or over direct RS-232 links.

         In order for Lynx to be distributed to a wide range of
         potential users, the protocol engine is being marketed as a
         SHAREWARE product.  This SHAREWARE Lynx package may be freely
         copied and distributed to anyone, by anyone, in its original,
         unmodified form (LYNX300.ZIP).

         When a potential user unZIPs a copy of this Lynx package,
         they are free to use it for a trial period of three weeks, in
         which duration they must decide whether Lynx is a product
         they can benefit from, and will use beyond the three week
         trial period.  If the individual continues to use the Lynx
         program beyond the three week trial period, then the product

         must be registered.  Registration of your copy of the Lynx
         software entitles you to a copy of Lynx which is serialized
         in your name.  Once you have registered your copy of Lynx,
         you are entitled to use any future revisions of the Lynx
         engine, with no further licensing fee.

         To register your copy of the Lynx engine, send a check or
         money order (U.S. funds, please!) in the amount of fifteen
         dollars ($15) payable to Matthew Thomas to the following
         address:

         Lynx Development
         c/o Matthew Thomas
         4210 North Main Street #226
         Racine, WI 53402

         When your order is received, we will send you the newest
         release of the Lynx engine, serialized in your name.

         If, in future, you obtain a shareware copy of Lynx that is
         newer than the one you receive when you register, you may use
         the LYNXNEW.EXE file (included on your registration disk) to
         upgrade the shareware version to a registered version.

         Note!  The 3.00 release of Lynx is the first version which
         requires registration.  You may continue to use any version
         of Lynx PRIOR to 3.00 without registering that copy.

         The Lynx engine program has been tested under many
         conditions--on various CPU types, clockspeeds, modems, and
         dial-up lines.  However, as with any software, it is
         impossible to guarantee that all bugs or incompatibilities
         have been discovered and corrected.  Therefore, Lynx
         Development and Matthew Thomas can not be held responsible
         for any errors, anomalies, bugs, or imcompatibilities which
         may occur under any conditions when using the Lynx engine.
         There is no warrantee, expressed or implied, as to the
         suitability of the Lynx engine or protocol for any express
         purpose.

         By registering Lynx, you are purchasing a single user license
         to use the Lynx engine program.  It is expressly forbidden
         for any registered copies of the Lynx engine to be
         distributed to other potential users.  The SHAREWARE
         (UNREGISTERED) version of Lynx may be distributed, in
         unmodified form, to anyone who wishes to evaluate it.

         _____________________________________________________________

         The Lynx protocol is based on the assumption that a
         connection between two sites is capable of full-duplex
         transmission.  Lynx will send a stream of data while
         simultaneously polling the receive-buffer for any
         interruptions from the other end.  On half duplex links, this
         will not work.  But almost all modems in use today are
         capable of full-duplex operation, so this specification is
         typically not a problem.

         The reason that Lynx makes use of full-duplex operations is
         to insure optimum transfer speed. When transmitting
         information, Lynx spends very little time waiting for the
         other end to respond.  On certain occasions--after a file
         header is transmitted or after recovering from a line error--
         Lynx will wait for the other end to resynchronize.

         Lynx can transfer up to 255 files in a single batch.
         Information which is passed from sender to receiver
         concerning each file includes:

           File name (8 character body, 3 character extension)
           Original time/date stamp (optional)
           File length (exact length of files is preserved by Lynx)
           Lynx version number (practically useless)

         The Lynx engine supports COM1 thru COM4, with adjustable
         configuration for COM3 and COM4.  Baud rates are adjustable
         up to 57600 baud.

         Lynx data transmissions are protected with CRC-32 error
         detection, and are recoverable either automatically by the
         protocol (Lynx will attempt to recover from up to twenty
         contiguous errors) or manually, by reconnecting--hopefully
         with a cleaner connection--and using the resume option of
         Lynx.  The resume option alerts the Lynx receive protocol to
         automatically test for the presence of a partially downloaded
         file before beginning the transfer, and to initiate the
         download at the point in the file where the last one ended,
         instead of resending the entire file.

         During the course of the transmission, Lynx will dynamically
         adjust the block size from 2 packets up to 16 packets to
         optimize for speed on clean connections.  Incidentally, a
         packet contains 64 bytes of data.

         The benefit of increasing the block size on error-free
         connections is in the fact that the overhead of block
         numbers, control sequences, and CRC-32 bytes is decreased for
         the entire file, actually decreasing the total number of
         bytes that must be transferred.




         Lynx Version 3.00                                 Page 3








         Lynx will also dynamically shrink block sizes if continuous
         errors are detected in the connection.  The benefit of this
         technique is that on an error-prone connection, short blocks
         take less time to retransmit (which is a natural occurrence
         during error recovery)

         Lynx tests each block for compressibility before transmitting
         it.  An RLE (Run-Length-Encoding) compression technique is
         used for this operation.  Generally, a block containing text
         information will be compressible.  Archived, ZIPPED, or other
         compressed files will likely not be further condensed by this
         technique.  Note that Lynx will always optimize transmission
         of each block--if RLE decreases the block length, it will be
         used; otherwise, the uncompressed packet will be sent.  In
         some implementations of RLE encoding, the compression
         technique may actually increase the length of the data being
         encoded.  This is not the case with Lynx.

         Lynx supports CTS/RTS hardware handshaking.  This type of
         handshaking is generally required when using Lynx at high
         speeds (9600 baud or faster).  Modems such as the ATI
         2400etc, the USR HST 14400, and other MNP or buffered modems
         require this type of handshaking.

         The Lynx engine program currently requires approximately 50
         kilobytes of free RAM to operate.  If a large number of files
         are transferred in a single batch--say, more than 10--then
         more memory may be required to hold the path/file
         specification information for those files.

         When opening files, the Lynx engine uses the DOS file mode
         identifier to protect the files from external access.
         While a file is being received (written to the disk), Lynx
         opens it as write-only, locked access (only writable by Lynx,
         and not readable by anyone).  While a file is being
         transmitted (read from the disk), Lynx opens it as read-only,
         shared access (readable by anyone, writable by no one).
         Once the transfer of each file is complete, that file is
         closed and can be accessed by anyone for any operation.

         The MS-DOS(TM) engine for Lynx is a program which can be
         called either directly from the DOS command line, or via
         batch files, such as from a communication program or BBS
         program.

         A help screen outlining the command line options for Lynx is
         shown by running the LYNX.EXE program without any command
         line parameters.  The help screen looks something like this:

         Following is a complete explanation of all parameters, and
         how each is used.  In the example command lines shown, the
         option which is being demonstrated is shown in CAPS.  When
         using Lynx command lines, case is not important.  Upper and
         lower case are treated equally.

                           -------------------------

          S or R : These two parameters specify whether Lynx should
                   send or receive files.  Note that one of the two
                   must be used, and must appear as the first
                   parameter on the command line.  All other
                   parameters may appear in any order.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send a file called FOO.BAR, which is in the
                   current directory, use the command:

                   lynx S foo.bar

                   To receive the same file, the "foo.bar" portion of
                   the command line can be removed:

                   lynx r

                   (the transmitter specifies filenames, not the
                   receiver.)



         Lynx Version 3.00                                 Page 5








           /baud : With this parameter, you may specify a baud rate to
                   use for the Lynx transfer.  Legal values are:

                   /300,/1200,/2400,/4800,/9600,/19200,/38400,
                   and /57600

                   Note:  If this parameter is not used, Lynx will
                   run at the current baud rate of the serial port.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send all files in the current directory, using a
                   baud rate of 9600 bps, use the following command:

                   lynx s /9600 *.*

                           -------------------------

            /com : This parameter allows you to specify which COM port
                   to use.  Values from 1 to 4 are legal.  If this
                   parameter is not specified in the command line, the
                   default COM port will be used.  Note that the
                   default port is 1, unless the DSZPORT variable is
                   used.  For information on this variable, see the
                   section entitled "Variables."

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To receive files over COM2, at the current baud
                   rate, use the command:

                   lynx r /2

                           -------------------------

             /NC : This parameter specifies that Lynx should ignore
                   the DCD (carrier signal) from the serial port.
                   Without this parameter, Lynx will abort the
                   transfer if the carrier signal is lost.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To receive files over COM1, at 19200 bps, without
                   monitoring the carrier signal, use the following
                   command:

                   lynx r /19200 /1 /NC

                           -------------------------

              /R : This parameter enables the Lynx resume option.
                   When this parameter is used, Lynx will
                   automatically check the receive path for the
                   presence of each file for which a file header is
                   received.  If the file already exists (in partial
                   form) Lynx will alert the sender to begin the
                   transfer at the end of the partial file.

                   This sounds more complicated than it really is.
                   The fact is, the /R (resume) option makes it
                   possible to partially download a file, abort the
                   transfer (perhaps in the case of a bad connection),
                   and continue the download later at the same point
                   where it left off.  This parameter is only
                   effective in Lynx receive mode.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send the files MYFILE and HISFILE, which are in
                   the directory C:\FILES; using COM2, at 1200 baud,
                   while monitoring the carrier signal and allowing
                   Lynx resumes, use the following command:

                   lynx s /1200 /2 /R c:\files\myfile c:\files\hisfile

                            ------------------------

              /B : This option causes Lynx to sound a bell upon
                   completion.  The bell will sound regardless of
                   whether the transfer was successful or not.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To receive files into the current directory, and
                   ring the bell when the transfer is done, use the
                   command:

                   lynx r /B

                           -------------------------

              /W : This parameter tells Lynx to wait for a keystroke
                   before exiting at the end of a transfer (whether
                   successful or otherwise).  This is useful if Lynx
                   is executed from a DesqView(TM) window or some
                   similar environment, and the user wishes to see how
                   Lynx finished before the window closes.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send all files in the directory C:\FILES that
                   have the extension EXE, and wait for a keystroke
                   when complete, use the command:

                   lynx s /W c:\files\*.exe

              /D : When this parameter is used, each file that is
                   received will be stamped with the current time and
                   date when that file is closed.
                   If /D is not used, Lynx will stamp each file with
                   the actual time and date of the original file,
                   which is passed via the header packet at the start
                   of each file in a batch.  The /D parameter is only
                   effective in Lynx receive mode.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To receive files into the current directory, and
                   stamp each of them with the current time and date,
                   use the command:

                   lynx r /D

                           -------------------------

              /T : When this parameter is specified, Lynx will drop
                   the DTR and RTS signals to the modem when the
                   transfer is completed.  This will generally cause a
                   modem to go "on-hook".  If you wish Lynx to hang up
                   the modem when complete, you can use this
                   parameter.  Without the /T parameter, the DTR and
                   RTS signals are returned to their original state
                   upon completion.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To cause the modem to hang up once all files in the
                   current directory are transmitted, use the command:

                   lynx s /T *.*

                           -------------------------

              /H : This option causes Lynx to use CTS/RTS handshaking
                   during the transfer.  This is usually required when
                   the baud rate is 9600 bps or faster.  Also when
                   using buffered modems, such as the ATI 2400etc, or
                   the USR HST 14400, you will need to use the /H
                   parameter.

                   BBS OPERATORS:
                   If the modem you are using on your BBS supports
                   CTS/RTS handshaking, you will need to use the /H
                   parameter.  The handshaking will only come into
                   effect when the modem is running at a speed that
                   requires it CTS/RTS flow control.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To receive files with CTS/RTS handshaking enabled,
                   use the command:

                   lynx r /H

              /S : When this option is used, Lynx will use direct
                   memory screen writes for all screen updates,
                   instead of BIOS screen writes.  Generally, direct
                   screen access is faster than BIOS access.  This
                   switch also enables a pop up window view instead of
                   the normal "teletype" display that Lynx otherwise
                   uses for feedback.  The colors of this pop-up
                   window may be configured using the LynxCo
                   environment variable (explained in the section
                   entitled "Variables.")
                   When using a multi-tasking environment like
                   DesqView(TM), this parameter should NOT be used.
                   This will avoid screen/window conflicts between
                   Lynx and other tasks which are running at the same
                   time.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send the file FOO.BAR using the color status
                   window, use the command:

                   lynx s /S foo.bar

                           -------------------------

              /L : This parameter forces Lynx to begin transmitting
                   1024 byte blocks instead of 128 byte blocks.  This
                   should only be used if the connection is clean.
                   Dynamic block scaling is still in effect if errors
                   occur.  This parameter is effective only in Lynx
                   transmit mode.  The /L parameter is available only
                   on registered copies of the Lynx engine.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send the file MYFILE.TXT over a clean
                   connection, use the command:

                   lynx s /L myfile.txt

                           -------------------------

              /G : This parameter forces Lynx to use the LYNXLOG
                   environment variable instead of the DSZLOG variable
                   for its log filename.  This is handy if you wish to
                   keep your Lynx log file separate from your DSZ(TM)
                   log file.  The /G option is available to registered
                   users only.

                           -------------------------

           @file : This parameter can be used by the sender to specify
                   a file that contains a list of path/file names of
                   files to be sent in a batch.  In the list file,
                   each file name must be separated by a carriage
                   return/line feed combination.  Blank lines are

                   ignored.  DOS wildcards are supported inside the
                   list of files only; the file name following the @
                   must be an absolute filename (no wildcards).

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send all the files listed in the file
                   LISTING.LST, use the command:

                   lynx s @LISTING.LST
                   In this case, the file LISTING.LST must be located
                   in the current directory, and when typed with the
                   DOS "type" command, may look something like this:

                   *.exe
                   *.com
                   readme.txt

                   This will cause Lynx to transmit all files with the
                   extension EXE, all files with the extension COM,
                   and the file named README.TXT.

                           -------------------------

            file : This parameter may consist of a full path and
                   file name of a file to send.  DOS wildcards are
                   fully supported.  A total of 255 individual files
                   may be send in a single batch.  This parameter may
                   be repeated on the command line to send multiple
                   files.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To send the file MYFILE.DOC (located in the current
                   directory) and the file FOO.BAR (located in the
                   directory C:\FILES), use the command:

                   lynx s MYFILE.DOC C:\FILES\FOO.BAR

                           -------------------------

            path : This parameter may specify a DOS drive and path
                   location where Lynx should place all files which
                   are received.  There must be a back-slash (\) at
                   the end of the specified path!

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To force Lynx receive files into the C:\TELIX
                   directory, use the command:

                   lynx r C:\TELIX\

                   If this parameter is not specified in the
                   receiver's command line, all received files will be
                   placed in the current DOS drive and directory.




         Lynx Version 3.00                                 Page 10








                   NOTE:  This parameter may also contain a file name.
                   Lynx will ignore the file name if it is specified,
                   because file names are always passed through the
                   communication link.  But some programs insist on
                   passing the file name as well as the receive path
                   to external protocols, so this is acceptable to
                   Lynx.  When you ARE specifying a file name, there
                   should be NO back-slash at the end.

                   EXAMPLE:
                   To force Lynx to receive a file into the C:\TELIX
                   directory, you may use the command:

                   lynx r C:\TELIX\MYFILE.EXT

                   The MYFILE.EXT portion will be tossed.

         _____________________________________________________________


         There are some DOS environment variables which are recognized
         by the Lynx engine program.  To set these variables, you can
         use the DOS 'SET' command.

         You may wish to place the SET commands in your autoexec.bat
         file, so once they're set, you can forget about them.

         The first two variables have been named the same as two of
         the DSZ(TM) variables to maintain some compatibility between
         the two engines.


           DSZPORT - This variable, if defined, specifies the default
                     COM port for Lynx to use.  It's value may be set
                     to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

                     EXAMPLE:
                     To force the default COM port to be 1, use the
                     DOS command:

                     SET DSZPORT=3

                           -------------------------

            DSZLOG - If this variable contains a legal DOS filespec,
                     Lynx will maintain a DSZ(TM) compatible log file
                     at the specified path and file name.

                     EXAMPLE:
                     To tell Lynx to maintain a log in the C:\BBS
                     directory, under the filename LYNXLOG.TXT, use
                     the DOS command:

                     SET DSZLOG=C:\BBS\LYNXLOG.TXT

                     The format of the log file is one line for each
                     file transferred, with the following information
                     in each entry line:

                     - The First field is 'x' for Lynx send, or 'X'
                       for Lynx receive.

                     - Next is the length of the file which was
                       transferred.

                     - After that is the baud rate.

                     - Then the average transfer rate, shown in
                       characters per second.

                     - Followed by the total number of errors which
                       occurred during transmission.

                     - The next field is always 0.  This was specified
                       in the DSZ(TM) documentation as the number of
                       flow control restrictions which occurred during
                       transmission.  Lynx does not record this value.

                     - Next is the length of the last block which was
                       transferred for the file in question.

                     - The last field in the log entry contains the
                       filespec which was transferred.

                           -------------------------

            LYNXP3 - This variable defines the port configuration of
                     COM port 3.  This is only effective if Lynx is
                     using COM3 during a transfer.

                     This variable specifies the base address (in hex)
                     and the interrupt (irq) that the port will use.

                     EXAMPLE:
                     To tell Lynx to configure COM3 for base port
                     address 2E8 and for interrupt 3 (irq3), use the
                     DOS command:

                     SET LYNXP3=2E8,3

                     The default configuration for COM3 is base
                     address 3E8 and interrupt 4 (irq4).



         Lynx Version 3.00                                 Page 12








            LYNXP4 - This variable is exactly the same as LYNXP3,
                     except it affects COM4.  The default
                     configuration for COM4 is base address 2E8 and
                     interrupt 3 (irq3).

                           -------------------------

            LYNXCO - This variable defines the screen colors when the
                     /S command line option is used.

                     To use this variable, you must pass 6 values, 3
                     digits each, separated by spaces or commas.  The
                     parameters set the following colors (in order of
                     appearance):

                     - Status attribute
                     - Status label attribute
                     - Fatal error message attribute
                     - Window frame attribute
                     - Window header attribute
                     - Window footer attribute

                     To calculate the color attributes, use the
                     following formula:

                     attribute = (background * 16) + foreground

                     The following values can be used for color
                     combinations:

                     Black   = 0      Dark Gray     = 8
                     Blue    = 1      Light Blue    = 9
                     Green   = 2      Light Green   = 10
                     Cyan    = 3      Light Cyan    = 11
                     Red     = 4      Light Red     = 12
                     Magenta = 5      Light Magenta = 13
                     Brown   = 6      Yellow        = 14
                     Gray    = 7      White         = 15

                     The default configuration is equivalent to:

                     LYNXCO=014,015,012,014,011,010

                     It is the author's opinion that using the public
                     domain program called LCS (Lynx Color Set), by
                     John Schuit, is the easiest and best way to set
                     the LYNXCO environment variable.  LCS is menu
                     driven, and allows the user to view the Lynx
                     window as the colors change, giving a better idea
                     of what the end result will look like.

           LYNXLOG - This environment variable is only used if the /G
                     parameter is specified on the Lynx command line,
                     in which case, this variable takes the place of
                     the DSZLOG variable (described above).  This
                     allows Lynx to keep a log separate from the DSZ
                     log file.

         When Lynx is finished, it will set the DOS errorlevel code to
         alert a calling program to success or failure of the
         transfer.  If Lynx is successful in the transfer, an
         errorlevel of 0 will be returned.  If correct parameters are
         given, but Lynx fails to successfully transfer any or all of
         the requested files, an errorlevel of 1 will be returned.  If
         Lynx is invoked without parameters (to show the help screen),
         an errorlevel of 2 will be returned.

         Any new releases of the Lynx engine are made available
         immediately on the Harbor Master BBS in Racine, WI
         at (414) 681-1123.  When you register your copy of Lynx, you
         will receive an upgrade program which will allow you to
         convert any SHAREWARE version of Lynx to a REGISTERED
         version.

         The following updates have been made to Lynx since its first
         release:

         3.00 (8/27/89) - First SHAREWARE RELEASE ($15 registration)
                        - Rewrote COM port routines in assembly
                          language for faster throughput on high-speed
                          connections.
                        - Added "modem lights" on /S display
                        - Added progress meter on /S display
                        - Lynx now properly senses the presence of the
                          requested COM port, be it 8250 or 16450, and
                          aborts with an appropriate message if one is
                          not present.
                        - Added /L parameter for clean connections.
                        - Added LYNXLOG support and the /G parameter.
                        - Fixed a bug in the RTS handshaking code.

         2.20 (7/30/89) - Fixed COM services to allow Lynx to access
                          UARTS other than the Intel 8250.
                        - Improved transmit speed when /H is used on
                          MNP modems in non-buffered mode.
                        - Lengthened the bell at the end of a transfer
                          (enabled with the /B command parameter).
                        - Fixed the COM routines to keep concurrently
                          executing programs from disabling Lynx's COM
                          port interrupts.
                        - Updated documentation.

         2.13 (7/08/89) - Changed the "path" parameter to allow
                          programs to pass a full file name on the
                          receiver command line (although only the
                          path is used).  This was a problem with RBBS
                          systems in particular.

         2.12 (7/01/89) - Hopefully all MNP problems fixed for good!
                        - Fixed COM routines to restore 8250
                          interrupts to their exact original state.
                          This affected older versions of ProComm, and
                          RYBBS systems.

         2.11 (6/21/89) - Added window option in /S parameter
                        - Added LYNXCO environment variable support.
                        - Fixed bug in sender--sometimes would not
                          respond to receiver cancellations.
                        - Improved error recovery
                        - Increased transmitter throughput for multi-
                          tasking systems and slow (4.77 MHz)
                          computers.

         2.10 (6/14/89) - Added CTS/RTS handshaking for MNP modems and
                          high-speed buffered modems
                        - Added 115200 baud option
                        - Removed DIRRX environment variable, due to
                          problems.
                        - Fixed bug in sender mode: lockup on lost
                          carrier.
                        - Added /S parameter for fast screen writes

         2.00 (6/3/89)  - Added list file compatibility
                        - Added /B, /W, /D, and /T switches
                        - Optimized communication routines
                        - Added configuration environment variables
                          for COM3 and COM4
                        - Added DIRRX environment variable
                        - Added a faster baud rate (57600 baud)
                        - Support for up to 255 files per batch
                          instead of only 35.

         1.3 - First official release
