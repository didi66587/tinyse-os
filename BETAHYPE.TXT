Just to inform those of you looking for a DOS client for WWW, your wait is
not far from over.

DosLynx is a DOS text based WWW client.
The minimum system requirments are:
        Chip:           8086
        Monitor:        Mono, B&W, or Color
        Mouse:          Optional
        Network:        Packet Drivers supported.
                        This includes SLIP.
DosLynx is currently made with:
        Compiler:       Borland C++ v3.1
        Librairies:     CERN's WWW
                        Borland's TurboVision
                        Erick Engelke's Waterloo TCP
0.1 Beta release will be made in April.  As in beta, I mean that I am
releasing DosLynx as a type of feedback tool to help me further implement
the product in a way seen fit by the users and, of course, for user bug
reports.

I will post relevant information for anonymous ftp retrieval to this newgroup
on the day of availability.  DosLynx will be free software.

Trodden Soil

I am trodden soil.
Dust covers my face.
Soles crush my nature
Revealing a hard empty space.
