This is a beta release of DosLynx for DOS compatible computers written by
Garrett&nbsp;Arch&nbsp;Blythe for the University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Kansas.
Wayne&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Buttles made some modifications to it in 1996.
The present maintainer of DosLynx is
 <A HREF="FCMEMADR.GIF">Fred&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Macall</A>.<p>

DosLynx is a hypertext browser with World Wide Web capabilities.
It is now offered in both 16-bit and 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode
variations or versions, as well as in its traditional Real&nbsp;Mode
version.<p>

This file provides information about installing, configuring, and using
all three DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b variations or versions.<p>

DosLynx is copyrighted by the University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Kansas and is free
for instructional and research educational use.  Non-educational use will
be licensed at a later date.<p>

DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b is available in EXEcutable form.<p>

<H2><A NAME="SystemRequirements">System Requirements</A></H2>

One of DosLynx's goals is to provide support for as many DOS users as
possible.  We have scaled DosLynx towards this end.<p>

The known system requirements, for the Real&nbsp;Mode version, are:<BR>

	<DL>
	<DT>CPU<DD>8086/8088 compatible.
        <DT>Memory<DD>512&nbsp;kilobytes free, or more, recommended.
        <DT>DOS<DD>Version&nbsp;3.0 or later, required.
        <DT>Hard Drive<DD>Two&nbsp;megabytes free, or more,
            recommended.
	<DT>Monitor<DD>Monochrome, Black and White, and Color supported.
	<DT>Graphics capability<DD>Optional.
	<DT>Mouse<DD>Optional.
        <DT>Network<DD>None, or Class&nbsp;1 (Ethernet) Packet Driver
            connected to a TCP/IP network.  You may, of course, emulate
            a Class&nbsp;1 Packet Driver if you have the required
            software for your particular system (i.e.:  PPP, ODI, SLIP,
            etc).
        <DD>&nbsp;
	</DL>

The Protected&nbsp;Mode versions have some additional requirements,
as follows:
        <DL>
        <DT>CPU<DD>80286 or later, for the 16-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version.
               <DD>80386 or later, for the 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version.
        <DT>Memory<DD>4&nbsp;MB or more, for the 16-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode
                      version.
                  <DD>6&nbsp;MB or more, for the 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode
                      version.  (It should run, with reduced memory
                      available for data, on a 4&nbsp;MB PC.)
        <DT>DOS<DD>Any version that can be fitted with a

<H2><A NAME="Installing">Installing DosLynx</A></H2>

This section assumes that you have not already installed DosLynx
version&nbsp;0.44&nbsp;beta on your hard drive.  If you already have,
you may <A HREF="#Configuring">skip this section</A>.<p>

<A HREF="#GettingDosLynx">Obtain a copy of the DosLynx Traditional
Real&nbsp;Mode Package</A> and place it in an appropriately named
directory on your hard drive.  We'll refer to this as your
"DosLynx Directory".  If your system can provide DPMI service,
you also may obtain a copy of the DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode Add-On
Package and place it in your DosLynx Directory, as well.<p>

C:\DOSINET>PKUNZIP DLX44BIN.ZIP<br>
from your DOS prompt in your DosLynx Directory.<p>

C:\DOSINET>PKUNZIP DLX44BPM.ZIP<br>
as well, if you have obtained DLX44BPM.ZIP.<p>

The <A HREF="#SuppliedFiles">supplied files</A> should be written
into your DosLynx directory.  You may now remove the
DLX44BIN.ZIP and DLX44BPM.ZIP file(s) from the directory, if you wish,
by entering the command(s)<br>
C:\DOSINET>DEL DLX44BIN.ZIP<br>
and, if appropriate,<br>
C:\DOSINET>DEL DLX44BPM.ZIP<p>

DEHEAD requires little installation attention.  However, if you choose
not to include your DosLynx directory in your PATH environment, you may
want to copy DEHEAD.EXE to a directory that is listed in your PATH.
So you'll have it handy at all times.<p>

TCPINFO tries to read WATTCP.CFG or DOSLYNX.CFG from its own directory.
So, it should be included in any directory(s), such as your DosLynx
directory, where you have copy(s) of those .CFG file(s) for it to read.<p>

EMU387.DXE isn't needed and may be DEL(eted) if your PC has a Numeric
Processing Extension or float arithmetic hardware.  Otherwise, keep
EMU387.DXE in the directory where you keep DOSLYNXS.EXE.<p>

<H2><A NAME="Configuring">Configuring DosLynx</A></H2>

If you want to use DosLynx for surfing the Web, you'll need an Ethernet
Card and DOS Packet&nbsp;Driver software for it.  Or, a dial-up modem
and Ethernet Packet&nbsp;Driver emulating PPP software for it.
If these things are new to you, consult
 <A HREF="http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/internet.html"
 >tvdog's classic papers at the oldskool Web site</A>.
Most of tvdog's papers are actually provided from
 <A HREF="ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet"
 >the oldskool ftp site</A>.
Beginning with version&nbsp;0.25&nbsp;beta, all of the problems the
DosLynx ftp client previously experienced in accessing that site have
been resolved.  As long as the mss=1500 specification given in
DOSLYNX.CFG is not changed.<p>

<A HREF="http://macall.net/doshwht.htm#modems">Fred's DOS
 Hardware How To</A> expands on tvdog's discussion of the problem of
finding a modern dial-up modem compatible with DOS software.  And,
 <A HREF="http://macall.net/dosiswht.htm">Fred's DOS
 Internet Software How To</A> provides links to two popular Ethernet
Packet Driver emulating PPP software packages.  Fred also has tips and
links for PC dial-up modem and serial port configuration and checking.<p>

On the other hand, if you have high speed Internet service, you will need
an Ethernet card for connecting with it.  And, a DOS Packet&nbsp;Driver
for that Ethernet card.  If you are unable to find a DOS
Packet&nbsp;Driver for your Ethernet card, a DOS ODI&nbsp;Driver
(for&nbsp;NetWare) or a DOS NDIS or NDIS&nbsp;v2 Driver may save the day.
Either of these may be "shimmed" to make a software "stack" that looks
and behaves like a DOS Packet&nbsp;Driver.  If you have a choice, you are
likely to find the ODI&nbsp;Driver based approach preferable.
The following two paragraphs sketch these two approaches.<p>

ODIPKT.COM, together with LSL.COM and a NET.CFG file, may be used to make
an ODI&nbsp;Driver look like a DOS Packet&nbsp;Driver.
(The ODI&nbsp;Driver, itself, is likely to be a .COM file.)
These components may be specified in a .BAT file to be run when you are
ready to use the resulting Packet&nbsp;Driver.  Once your .BAT file has
become "stable", you may add a CALL, to it, from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
if you like.  ODIPKT.COM&nbsp;v3.1 is available from
 <a href="http://www.danlan.com">Dan&nbsp;Lanciani</a>, in his ODIPKT.ZIP
package.  A suitable LSL.COM may be found, as LSL.CO_, in the
DR-DOS&nbsp;v7.03 package.  Diskette image files for installing
DR-DOS&nbsp;v7.03 may be found by following link(s) from:
 <a href="http://www.drdos.net/download.htm"
 >http://www.drdos.net/download.htm</a> .
 You use DISKCOPY.COM to copy such image file(s) onto diskette(s).
Then, you use the DR-DOS PNUNPACK.EXE utility to unpack LSL.CO_ into
LSL.COM.  PNUNPACK.EXE is found in DR-DOS&nbsp;v7.03 DISK01.144.
LSL.CO_ is found in DISK03.144.<p>

DIS_PKT.DOS, together with PROTMAN.DOS, PROTMAN.EXE, NETBIND.COM, and a
PROTOCOL.INI file, may be used to make a DOS NDIS or NDIS&nbsp;v2 Driver
look like a DOS Packet&nbsp;Driver.  (The DOS NDIS or NDIS&nbsp;v2
Driver, itself, is likely to be a .DOS file.  DOS NDIS Drivers are not to
be confused with the NDIS&nbsp;v3, NDIS&nbsp;v4, and higher numbered NDIS
Driver versions provided for Windows systems.  The Windows NDIS Drivers
are likely to be .SYS files.)  PROTMAN.DOS, your DOS NDIS Driver, and
DIS_PKT.DOS are specified, on DEVICE=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lines,
in your CONFIG.SYS file.  You place these .DOS files, together with
NETBIND.COM, PROTMAN.EXE, and your PROTOCOL.INI file, in a directory
specified on the CONFIG.SYS line for PROTMAN.DOS.  You run NETBIND.COM
when you are ready to use the Packet&nbsp;Driver that results from all
this software.  A NETBIND.COM call may be placed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file, if you like.  DIS_PKT.DOS&nbsp;v1.11 is available from
 <a href="http://www.danlan.com">Dan&nbsp;Lanciani</a>, in his
DIS_PKT.ZIP package.  Suitable PROTMAN.DOS and PROTMAN.EXE components
may be found, as PROTMAN.DO_ and PROTMAN.EX_, in the
"Microsoft&nbsp;Network&nbsp;Client&nbsp;3.0" package.  This package
includes a suitable NETBIND.COM file, as well.  This package was
distributed widely in the \CLIENTS\MSCLIENT directory of the Microsoft
Windows NT4-Server CD-ROM.  You use EXPAND.EXE, also included in the
package, to expand PROTMAN.DO_ and PROTMAN.EX_ into PROTMAN.DOS and
PROTMAN.EXE.  All of these files are found in the package's DSK3-1.EXE
file.<p>

There are lots of Web sites with more information on these arrangements.
You'll probably need to consult some of them in order to see how to
prepare a suitable NET.CFG or PROTOCOL.INI file.  Use searches like:<br>
+dos&nbsp;+lsl.com&nbsp;+odi&nbsp;+driver<br>
 or<br>
+dos&nbsp;+protman.dos&nbsp;+ndis&nbsp;+driver<br>
 to find them.<p>

If you want to use the DosLynx e-mail client, will your ISP require the
use of SMTP AUTH LOGIN for relaying your e-mail?  If so, you will need
to provide base64 encoded versions of your e-mail ID and password.
One method for performing the base64 encoding needed is explained in:<br>
 <A HREF="http://macall.net/PMSMTP.TXT"
 >http://macall.net/PMSMTP.TXT</A>&nbsp;.<br>
 Look for the section headed: Base64-Encoding.
Everything PMSMTP.TXT says about configuring PMSMTP for SMTP AUTH LOGIN
applies directly to DosLynx, with just two exceptions:
The DosLynx configuration file is named DOSLYNX.CFG, rather than
PMSMTP.CFG.  And, base64 encoded password data to be given on the
command line is prefixed with /S for DosLynx, while left unadorned for
PMSMTP.<p>

PMSMTP.TXT's detailed procedure for base64 encoding is stated in terms
of use of the Pegasus e-mail client.  However, if you won't be using the
Pegasus package for e-mail, you may find the DOS MPACK program a more
convenient alternative.  It is available in a small package from:<br>
 <a
 href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/ccic/software/dos/networking/mpack15d.zip"
 >http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/ccic/software/dos/networking/mpack15d.zip
 </a><br>
 or<br>
 <a
 href="https://www.chebucto.ns.ca/software/dos/compression/mpack15d.zip"
 >https://www.chebucto.ns.ca/software/dos/compression/mpack15d.zip</a>&nbsp;.
 <p>

Once you have decided on your communications arrangement and determined
the needed TCP/IP parameter(s), edit the DosLynx configuration file, named
DOSLYNX.CFG, with any text editor.  Work through each keyword and provide
the appropriate value.  Ample configuration instructions are included in
the sample configuration file supplied.  Once finished, save the modified
file as ASCII text.  The Real&nbsp;Mode and Protected&nbsp;Mode versions
of DosLynx all share your DOSLYNX.CFG file.  Comments indicate where a
few configuration options are ignored by the Protected&nbsp;Mode
versions.  The rest of the options apply for all three DosLynx versions.
A<br>
TCPINFO DLX ALL<br>
command may be used to get a more-or-less comment-free view of your
DOSLYNX.CFG file.<p>

If you wish to save your Hotlist, which you've used with an old version of
DosLynx, make sure you don't overlay it with the new one from the release
package.  The easiest thing to do is to rename it before installing a new
DosLynx release.  If necessary, simply change the hotlist= specification
in the configuration file to point to your renamed Hotlist file.<p>

If you expect to be receiving at least an occasional graphic file, you'll
want to tailor DLXVIEW.BAT to your situation.  Whenever you receive or
reference a .BMP, .GIF, .JPG, .PCX, .PNG, or .TIF file, DosLynx will call
DLXVIEW.BAT with the full name of the graphic file.  You specify the name
of your graphics viewer and any parameter(s) it needs in DLXVIEW.BAT.<p>

If you have an 8088 based PC with a Hercules monochrome graphics adapter,
you may have to dig deep to find a viewer that can display .JPGs.
Two that work fairly well (though, slowly on older machines) are:
 <A HREF="http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/graphics.html"
 >DMGIF&nbsp;v1.2</A> and
 <a href="http://cd.textfiles.com/cream/cream09/screen/2show204.zip"
 >2SHOW&nbsp;v2.04</a>.  These are both shareware viewers.<p>

If you have a '286 based, '386 based, or more recent PC and/or a CGA, EGA,
VGA, or more recent video adapter, you'll find progressively more viewers
to try out.  One that works well for limited machines with at least a CGA
adapter is
 <A HREF="http://hplx.pgdn.de/lxpic.zip">LXPIC&nbsp;v7.3</A>.
LXPIC is a freeware viewer.  The sample DLXVIEW.BAT file provided invokes
LXPIC on a machine with an SVGA card.  To minimize complication(s) when
using the DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode versions, you'll do well to avoid
viewers that (also) use Protected&nbsp;Mode.  LXPIC is a good choice from
this standpoint, too.  However, it should be possible to use a
Protected&nbsp;Mode viewer with a register size matching the DosLynx
Protected&nbsp;Mode version's register size.  Or, vice versa.
That is, if your favorite viewer is a 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode program,
use only the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode or 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode versions
with it, to maintain compatibility.  Once you have your DLXVIEW.BAT working
well, you'll probably want to put a copy of it in a directory listed in
your PATH environment variable.<p>

It turns-out that there is a way to use a viewer like LXPIC on an 8088
based system with only a Hercules monochrome graphics adapter!
To do that, you'll need Hercules based Color Graphics Adapter Emulation
software.  One Emulator that works well, with LXPIC on an 8088 based PC, is
 <a
 href="https://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/pub/simtelnet/msdos/screen/hgcib202.zip"
 >HGCIBM&nbsp;v2.02</a>.  This is a shareware package.
The LXPIC/HGCIBM combination delivers image quality comparable to
2SHOW&nbsp;v2.04's.  But, it requires only about half as long to prepare
each image!  Use LXPIC's /R5 command line option, in your DLXVIEW.BAT file,
to adapt LXPIC to the emulated CGA display's pixel aspect ratio.
To maintain the Hercules adapter's excellent text quality between image
displays, you also may want to keep HGCIBM resident but disabled most of
the time.  In that case, add a command enabling HGCIBM, to the beginning
of your DLXVIEW.BAT file.  Then, end it with a command disabling HGCIBM,
again.<p>

Of the three viewers discussed here, only 2SHOW&nbsp;v2.04 is able to
display .PNG files.  So, you may be tempted to use it together with, say,
LXPIC.  Unfortunately, 2SHOW&nbsp;v2.04 may be hard to use together with
another viewer.  Because, display timing differences between your two
viewers may require you to continually readjust your monitor for
stability, with each viewer.  If this isn't an issue with your monitor,
you might extend your DLXVIEW.BAT file to select among your viewers.
On the basis of whether a .PNG file is to be displayed, or not.<p>

<H2><A NAME="Environment">Environment Settings</A></H2>

DosLynx refers to several DOS Environment variables to augment its 
configuration information.  You manage these by means of the DOS SET command.
<P>

C:\DOSINET>SET<BR>
will display all of your specified Environment variable settings, if any.
Once you've decided how you want to specify these variables, you may add SET
commands for them to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  For example:<P>

SET TMP=C:\WIN95\TEMP<BR>
SET TZ=EST5EDT<P>

DosLynx refers to the following DOS Environment variables:<BR>

<DL>
<DT>
387
 <DD>DosLynxS may probe your PC for a Numeric Processing Extension (NPX)
     or float arithmetic unit, upon attempting to fetch an https
     (or,&nbsp;SSL) URL.  Apparently, this may be problematic on a few
     PCs lacking an NPX.  You may SET 387=N to declare that your PC has
     no NPX and prevent that probing.  In this case, a copy of EMU387.DXE
     should be located in the same directory as DOSLYNXS.EXE.
     Or, the EMU387 Environment variable should be SET to specify the
     full path to EMU387.DXE.  387 is ignored by the DosLynx 16-bit
     versions.  If 387=N isn't specified, DosLynxS may probe for an NPX
     as described above.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
COMSPEC
 <DD>DosLynx refers to COMSPEC when it needs to know the full PATH and name
     for your shell or command interpreter.  This is needed when
     "shelling out to DOS" and when invoking DLXVIEW to display a graphics
     file.  COMSPEC may be altered by means of a SET command, as explained
     above.  However, it usually gets set as a side effect of a SHELL=
     line in your CONFIG.SYS file.  If COMSPEC is unspecified, DosLynx
     will use:  command.com .
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
EMU387
 <DD>DosLynxS may look for EMU387.DXE, when it attempts to fetch an https
     (or,&nbsp;SSL) URL, if it determines that your PC lacks an NPX or
     float arithmetic unit.  EMU387 may be set with the full path to
     EMU387.DXE, to specify its location.  Otherwise, if EMU387 isn't
     set, DosLynxS looks for EMU387.DXE in the same directory as
     DOSLYNXS.EXE.  EMU387 is ignored by the DosLynx 16-bit versions.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
HOME
 <DD>DosLynx refers to HOME when accessing documents or files via ftp.
     HOME may be used to specify the first directory in DOS PATH(s) that
     provide local mirror(s), on your system, for other ftp sites.
     The DOS PATH(s) developed are as follows:
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>home/WWW/ftp/host/path
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Where:  home is the value of the HOME Environment variable, and ftp,
     host, and path come from the ftp://host/path URL being accessed.
     These DOS PATHs get delivered to DOS Interrupt&nbsp;0x21 functions
     0x4300 (Get File Attributes) and 0x3D (Open File with Handle) calls.
     In at least some versions of DOS, these functions don't mind treating
     those (forward) slashes the same as back slashes.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>If HOME is unspecified, DosLynx will use /tmp for the home portion
     of the DOS PATHs shown above.  ftp://&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. URLs will
     get accessed via TCP/IP, as expected, if any part(s) of their DOS
     PATHs, developed as shown above, are missing on your system.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
TMP
 <DD>DosLynx refers to TMP when developing temporary file names.
     It attempts to develop names that don't duplicate any of the file
     name(s) already present in the directory given by TMP.  Though it
     seems to duplicate the tempdir= configuration file option, you
     normally assign the complete path and name of your temporary
     directory, without a trailing back slash, to TMP.  An example is
     given above, near the beginning of this section.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
TZ
 <DD>DosLynx refers to TZ to determine the time zone offset field it adds
     to the end of the Date:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. header line on each
     e-mail that you send.  Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.27b, the
     TZ Environment variable is expected to have an EST5EDT style value.
     More generally, this will be a value of the form:  tzn[+/-]h[h][dtn]
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Where:
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>tzn is a three character abbreviation for your Time Zone's Name.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>h or hh is the difference between Greenwich Mean Time and your
     time zone's standard time, in Hours.  This value is negative for time
     zones east of Greenwich.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>dtn is an optional three character abbreviation for your Daylight
     saving Time zone Name.  Specify this part only if your time zone
     makes a one hour shift, for the summer, on a schedule matching that
     used in the United States, before 2007.  On this schedule, clocks
     were advanced an hour on the morning of the first Sunday of April,
     each year.  And, they were set back an hour on the morning of the
     last Sunday of October, each year.  If dtn is present, DosLynx will
     adjust the time zone offset field it develops, accordingly, while
     daylight saving time is in effect.  If you have a daylight saving
     time shift that doesn't match the old U.S. schedule, you'll have to
     leave dtn out of your TZ value.  Then, you'll have to adjust your
     SET&nbsp;TZ= command twice a year, when you change your local time.
     For example:  If you used to use SET&nbsp;TZ=EST5EDT, in the U.S.:
     You'll now use SET&nbsp;TZ=EDT4 in the spring and summer and
     SET&nbsp;TZ=EST5 in the fall and winter.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>If TZ is left unspecified, the time zone offset field will be
     developed as if TZ=EST5EDT were specified.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
USER
 <DD>DosLynx may refer to USER when accessing an ftp://&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
     URL that doesn't include a userid field.  That is, when accessing a
     simple ftp://host/path style URL.  In this case, if the ftp host
     requests a user id, DosLynx will respond with a USER&nbsp;anonymous
     command.  And, if the ftp host requests a password, DosLynx will
     respond with a PASS&nbsp;user@ command.  Where, user is the value of
     the USER Environment variable.  If USER isn't specified,
     PASS&nbsp;WWWuser@ will be sent.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
WWW_access_GATEWAY
 <DD>DosLynx may refer to WWW_access_GATEWAY when accessing an access type
     URL.  Where, access may be file, ftp, http, or news.  For ftp and http
     type URLs, this only occurs if no matching proxy server is configured
     in DOSLYNX.CFG.  (So, any ftp_proxy= and/or http_proxy= configuration
     option specified overrides any WWW_ftp_GATEWAY and/or WWW_http_GATEWAY
     Environment specification.)  WWW_access_GATEWAY may be set to specify
     a proxy server in the same way that DOSLYNX.CFG's ftp_proxy= and
     http_proxy= configuration options do.  If WWW_access_GATEWAY is found
     unspecified for the access type of the URL in process, the URL is
     accessed without using a proxy server.
</DL>
<P>
The DosLynx 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version's DJGPP/GNU run-time
package may refer to the following additional DOS Environment
variables:  DJGPP, FNCASE, LFN, and TMPDIR.  However, DosLynx doesn't
intend any use for those, presently.  If you set any of them, you might
get unexpected results, in one area or other.  If you do get unexpected
results, you might check to see if any of those variables are defined in
your Environment.<P>

<H2><A NAME="CodePage850">Code Page 850 Cook Book</A></H2>

Beginning with version&nbsp;0.33b, DosLynx provides complete support for
the ISO-8859-1 (8-bit) character set.  ISO-8859-1 adds 96 displayable
characters to the ASCII (7-bit) set and is said to be the base or default
character set for HTML.  The complete ISO-8859-1 support now in DosLynx
includes recognition of the standard "entity names" for all of those added
characters.  Beginning with version&nbsp;0.35b, DosLynx also provides
limited support for UTF-8 document encoding.  As of version&nbsp;0.38b,
DosLynx supports all of the UTF-8 characters and character sequences
corresponding to the ISO-8859-1 character set, together with thirty two
additional characters that aren't included in ISO-8859-1.<P>

In order for you to be able to see all of the ISO-8859-1 characters properly,
your DOS system will have to be using display Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850.
Unfortunately, for users in most english speaking countries, your DOS default
or hardware display Code&nbsp;Page probably will be 437.  You can check your
system by entering a CHCP command.  If Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850 isn't the
default for your system, you will need to install the support for it included
in DOS.  Fortunately, in that case, Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850 will be the
"alternate" for your system's country or language.  That means that you may
install it, for your display and/or printer, without changing or adding
anything else to your system's country or language settings.  Rest assured
that the rendering won't be any worse than it was with early DosLynx
versions, if you choose not to install Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850 support on
your system.<P>

To install display Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850, you will need an EGA,
Hercules&nbsp;Plus, or better display adapter, and the DOS files DISPLAY.SYS
and EGA.CPI.  (There may not be any way to provide Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850
support with MDA, Hercules, and CGA display adapters.)  First, you'll need to
add DISPLAY.SYS to your CONFIG.SYS file, with a line like the following:<P>

DEVICE=C:\DOSDIR\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(EGA,437,1)<P>

You use EGA in that line for any EGA or better display adapter.
Use your system's actual path to DISPLAY.SYS and default Code Page
number, if they aren't C:\DOSDIR\ and 437.  You may need
Hercules provided software for doing this with the Hercules&nbsp;Plus,
and later, line of display adapters.<P>

Once you have DISPLAY.SYS installed, you will be able to issue the
following three MODE commands:<P>

MODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE=((850)C:\DOSDIR\EGA.CPI)<BR>
MODE CON CODEPAGE SELECT=850<BR>
MODE [CON [CODEPAGE]]<P>

Of course, these commands may be added to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, once you
get comfortable with them.  The MODE&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;PREPARE=
command provides the setup needed for loading the Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850
support.  Again, the C:\DOSDIR\ part in that may need adjustment for your
system.  The MODE&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;SELECT= command actually loads
it into your display adapter.  (This command may be modified in the
obvious way and reissued to restore the default Code Page number mentioned
in the DEVICE=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;DISPLAY.SYS line.)
This treatment may not change your CHCP command's result.  So, use a
MODE&nbsp;CON&nbsp;CODEPAGE, MODE&nbsp;CON, or even a bare MODE command,
to check your display's setup, once you have DISPLAY.SYS installed.<P>

If your printer is an IBM LaserPrinter, Proprinter, Quietwriter, or
compatible, its setup for Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850 resembles that described
above for the display.  You'll need to install PRINTER.SYS in CONFIG.SYS and
MODE&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;PREPARE= the appropriate one of DOS's nnnn.CPI
files.  You use PRN or LPTn, as appropriate, in place of CON in the commands
shown above.  Also, substitute the printer's four digit type number for EGA
in those commands.  Otherwise, consult your printer's documentation for the
arrangements it uses for supporting Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850.<P>

<H2><A NAME="CommandLine">Command Line Options</A></H2>

DosLynx has the following command line switches and options.
Most of the command line options override an equivalent configuration file
option named, in each case, below.  All command line options are case
insensitive except for base64 encoded e-mail password data and some
portion(s) of some URLs.<BR>

<DL>
<DT>
/B
 <DD>This switch will hide the clock, socket activity, free temporary
     disk space, and free heap memory space numbers and the Messages
     window for the duration of the current DosLynx session.
     This option was added to provide a way to keep the screen uncluttered
     for blind users, as those changing numbers and messages cause some
     problems with screen readers.  Other users may appreciate the
     uncluttered screen, too.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/U
 <DD>This switch will hide the clock, free temporary disk space, and free
     heap memory space numbers for the duration of the current DosLynx
     session.  As it doesn't do away with the socket activity number and
     the Messages window, /U operation seems much closer to normal
     operation than to /B operation.  One reason for using the /U switch
     might be to avoid the sluggish performance that may result from
     having to use DosLynx with its temporary directory located on a drive
     with removable media.  A drive such as a diskette or Zip drive.
     These drives may be slow to respond to the repeated getdfree(&nbsp;)
     calls that DosLynx makes.  DosLynx uses these calls to maintain the
     free temporary disk space number at the bottom of the display.
     That slowness is what may make DosLynx sluggish.  Both /B and /U let
     DosLynx skip its getdfree(&nbsp;) calls and avoid that sluggishness.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/P
 <DD>This is the most important command line option.  If you will
     be executing DosLynx from a directory other than the one you
     installed it in, you must use the /P option.  /P specifies
     the directory in which DosLynx will find its configuration file
     DOSLYNX.CFG and the errorhtml file ERROR.HTM.  If you installed
     DosLynx in the directory C:\DLX, then you should use the /P option
     as follows:
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
C:\DOSINET>doslynx /PC:\DLX<P>

 <DD>To avoid having to retype the /P option every time you use DosLynx,
     create a DOS batch file specifying the /P option and place the batch
     file in a directory specified in your DOS PATH environment variable.
     The supplied DOSLYNX.BA_ file provides an example of this technique.
     You may:  COPY it into a directory on your PATH.
     RENAME it DOSLYNX.BAT.  And, edit it for your situation.  Once you
     have the /P option being specified routinely, you will be free to
     start DosLynx from any directory where you want to access or save
     files.  That will greatly simplify your interactions with the local
     file dialogs.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/S
 <DD>This option was added to DosLynx in version&nbsp;0.31&nbsp;beta.
     It may be used to specify your base64 encoded e-mail password, for
     the e-mail client's use in performing SMTP AUTH LOGIN authentication.
     It overrides or replaces the b64passw= configuration file option.
     Specifying this secret on the command line allows it to be kept
     separate from your DOSLYNX.CFG file in your system.  Note that your
     base64 encoded e-mail password is not to be enclosed in quotes when
     given in the /S command line option.  Here is a sample /S command line
     option specification:
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
C:\DOSINET>doslynx /SY29kZmljaGU=<P>

 <DD>To avoid having to retype the /S option every time you use DosLynx,
     you may want to add it to the DOSLYNX command in your DOSLYNX.BAT
     file.  Of course, a danger in doing this is that your base64 encoded
     e-mail password might then be exposed to anyone in a position to
     study your DOSLYNX.BAT file.  The supplied DOSLYNX.BA_ file now
     includes an example of this technique.  Note that an at sign also
     has been added to the beginning of the DOSLYNX command, in
     DOSLYNX.BA_.  That keeps the DOSLYNX command, with your base64
     encoded e-mail password, from being displayed while DosLynx is
     loading.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/T
 <DD>This option specifies the temporary directory where DosLynx
     will create its temporary files, overriding the tempdir=
     configuration file option.  Note that this path should end with a
     back slash.  If you decide to use the directory C:\TEMP as the place
     to store temporary files, then you may use /T in the following
     manner:
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
C:\DOSINET>doslynx /TC:\TEMP\
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/V
 <DD>This option tells DosLynx what text mode to begin in,
     overriding the textmode= configuration file option.  /VLOW tells
     DosLynx to use the 25 row text mode.  /VHIGH tells DosLynx to
     attempt to use the 43 or 50 row text modes available to EGA and
     VGA compatible video adapters.  This setting also may be changed
     from within DosLynx, after you have started it.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/H
 <DD>This option tells DosLynx if it should load the home page
     you specified in the configuration file.  It overrides the
     loadhome= configuration file option.  /HON tells DosLynx to load
     the home page on startup.  /HOFF tells DosLynx not to load the
     home page on startup.  /HOFF is forced if you also specify a URL
     on the command line.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/L
 <DD>This option tells DosLynx how many loaded documents to keep
     in memory before it starts releasing the oldest unviewed file.
     This overrides the loaded= configuration file option.
     If decide you want DosLynx to keep the last 5 ready in memory, then
     you may use the /L option in the following way:
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
C:\DOSINET>doslynx /L5
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
/N
 <DD>This option tells DosLynx if it should attempt network access.
     It overrides the networked= configuration file option.  To turn off
     network access, use /NNO.  To allow network access, use /NYES.
     When viewing local files "offline" without a network connection
     established, specify /NNO to forestall most networking error messages
     and timeout delays.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
URL
 <DD>This command line option is actually a URL that you would like
     DosLynx to load from the command line.  It can be any valid URL
     that will fit within the 128 character DOS command line length
     limit.  As long as it doesn't contain any special character(s)
     that have special meanings within DOS commands.  Or, it can be a
     DOS path to a file.  Or, simply, a filename within the current
     directory.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>If you have a URL that is too long to be specified on the DosLynx
     command line or contains troublesome character(s), you need to
     take an indirect approach.  You might enter your difficultURL
     as an anchor, into a short and otherwise empty somename.HTM file.
     That is, prefix your difficultURL with &lt;A&nbsp;HREF=" .
     And, suffix it with "&gt;visiblelinktext&lt;/A&gt; .
     So that your somename.HTM file contains:
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
&lt;A&nbsp;HREF="difficultURL"&gt;visiblelinktext&lt;/A&gt;
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Then, when you specify somename.HTM on the DosLynx command line,
     you will be provided with your
     <A HREF="difficultURL">visiblelinktext</A> as a link to the
     difficultURL.  There is no need for &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;HEAD&gt;,
     nor any of the other trappings of a complete HTML file, within
     your somename.HTM file.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>When a path or URL is specified on the command line, your home page
     will not be loaded unless you specify its path or URL, too.
     To have DosLynx load this document (readme.htm) on startup, execute
     one of the following commands from the directory in which you
     installed DosLynx:
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
C:\DOSINET>doslynx readme.htm
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
C:\DOSINET>doslynx file:///readme.htm
</DL>
   
<H2><A NAME="UsingDosLynx">Using DosLynx</A></H2>

DosLynx is a straightforward menu driven application.<p>

A user has several ways to activate the DosLynx menus; pressing F10,
pressing Alt plus one of the highlighted menu letters, and by a single
left button mouse click.<p>

Following are a listing of all menu entries or commands and their
functionality.  Short-Cut keys are designated for many of the commands,
including all of the commands in the File and Navigate menus.  These are
listed along the right side of each menu.  The <a href="keys.txt">KEYS.TXT</a>
document included in the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode Package also provides a list
of the Short-Cut keys.  In the following headings, menu titles and menu
entries are presented side by side, with the '|' character as a separator,
and followed by any designated Short-Cut key(s), in parenthesis.<BR>

<DL>
<DT>
File|Open URL... (F3)
 <DD>Allows you to directly enter a URL.  Once you've entered it, "press"
     the Open or Download button.  (These buttons were introduced in
     DosLynx&nbsp;version&nbsp;0.25&nbsp;beta.  Completing your entry with
     the Enter key is equivalent to pressing the Open button since it is
     the default button for this dialog.  The Open button replaces the OK
     button previously provided.)  DosLynx will attempt to load the
     specified URL.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>If the Open button or equivalent is used and the specified document
     is presentable (such as an HTML or text file), the resulting view will
     be displayed in a new window.  If the specified document is
     un-presentable (such as an .EXE file) or an image (such as a .BMP,
     .GIF, .JPG, .PCX, .PNG, or .TIF file), DosLynx will prompt you for a
     local file name in which to save it.  After an image has been saved,
     DosLynx will swap most of itself out of memory and invoke DLXVIEW to
     display it.  After viewing, use the means provided by your viewer to
     exit from its display and return to DosLynx.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>If the Download button is used, DosLynx will attempt to fetch the
     specified document or file and un-conditionally prompt you for a local
     file name in which to save it.  This operation adds a header or prefix
     to the local file copy made.  It is equivalent to the operation
     provided by the File|Save&nbsp;Source and
     Navigate|Download&nbsp;Selection menu entries described below.
     As described in the paragraph above, un-presentable files get saved
     in transparent local file copies even when the Open button is used.
     So, the Download button's main purpose is to avoid the refetch that
     otherwise would be needed to obtain a local file copy of a
     presentable document.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>The File|Open&nbsp;URL... dialog's history contains the last few
     URL(s) that you've entered.  It also may contain URL(s) entered on
     the DosLynx command line and, since DosLynx&nbsp;v0.29b, URL(s)
     pasted over from the Navigate|Go&nbsp;To and
     Navigate|Show&nbsp;Destination&nbsp;URL commands.
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.41b, URL(s) also may be pasted over
     from the File|Clip&nbsp;View command.  From within the dialog,
     the down arrow key or mouse may be used to bring these item(s)
     into view.  The most recent (bottom) item will be given "focus",
     to start.  Any one of these history item(s) may then be selected,
     for priming the dialog's input line.  Once primed, the input line
     may be used as is, or after editing.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>No HTTP Referer: Header field is ever provided in request(s)
     initiated by means of the File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Open Local... (Shift-F3)
 <DD>Allows you to select a local file from an available DOS path.
     DosLynx will convert the file name into a URL and attempt to load
     the file.  The specified file will be displayed in a new window
     or displayed by DLXVIEW as described above for the
     File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry's Open button.  This dialog's
     history contains the last few DOS path(s) that you've entered.
     It also may contain DOS path(s) entered on the DosLynx command line.
     And, beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.41b, full paths to all saved
     local files.  These history item(s) may be accessed and used as
     described above for the File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Close (Alt-F3)
 <DD>This menu item directs DosLynx to close the currently active window,
     so that it is no longer viewable on your display.  (The Messages
     window may be brought back after being closed, however.)
     This command duplicates the Window|Close command.
     Closing a window designates the memory allocated to it a candidate
     for reuse.  The Esc key provides a short-cut for closing the Messages
     window.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Save Rendering... (F2)
 <DD>When selected, DosLynx will prompt you for a local file name in
     which to save the document in the currently active window.
     Your document will be exported as DOS Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850 text.
     This enables its use by other PC utilities that are unaware of
     ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8 coding.  However, as of version&nbsp;0.44b,
     DosLynx still has no way to import and correctly interpret such a
     file.  If it contains any non-ASCII character(s) or character
     entities.  (That is, characters or character entities with code
     values outside of the ASCII range of 0 to 127 decimal.)
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>This menu entry may be used for saving documents containing MIME
     or UU encoded data.  However, it isn't likely to be useful for
     saving documents containing yEncoded data.  If your intent is to
     save a document "transparently", or for further use with DosLynx,
     you should use one of the three save source or download type
     commands that DosLynx offers.  These are File|Open&nbsp;URL...
     (with its Download button) (above), File|Save&nbsp;Source
     (below), and Navigate|Download&nbsp;Selection (further below).
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Print Rendering... (Alt-P)
 <DD>When selected, DosLynx will prompt you for a DOS device to which
     to print the rendering.  The appropriate DOS device to enter is
     the one to which your printer is connected, such as LPT1.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Clip View (Alt-V)
 <DD>Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.41b, this menu entry provides for
     clipping or extracting URL(s) or other relatively short citations
     from rendered document(s).  You express each clipping's content
     by means of a Turbo Vision TMemo (editor) dialog provided.
     This dialog gets primed with a copy of the presently viewable
     document screen's text.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Clipping(s) may be pasted into the File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry
     dialog's history list, for use.  Or, saved in a local (clip board)
     file.  In turn, saved clipping file(s) may be pasted into the
     e-mail client's TMemo dialog.  Or, into the HTML Form Textarea
     input control's TMemo dialog.  To facilitate these pastings, full
     paths to saved local file(s) will get copied into the
     File|Open&nbsp;Local... dialog's history list.  URL(s) to be pasted
     may flow over several lines, if necessary.  However, they are
     limited to a maximum length of 250 octets.  Clippings to be saved
     are limited to a maximum length of about 4000 octets.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>The TMemo editor provides a text selection feature to facilitate
     clipping away large text areas.  This is explained near the end of
     this section.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Save Source (Alt-S)
 <DD>DosLynx will attempt to refetch the document on display in the
     currently active window and prompt you for a local file name in
     which to save it.  If an HTTP Referer: field was sent in the
     request that obtained the document on display, that will be
     repeated here.  Unless HTTP Referer Mode has been turned OFF in
     the meantime.  The local file copy will be prefixed with a
     &lt;BASE&nbsp;HREF="&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;"&gt; HTML tag
     indicating where it came from.  This enables all of the document's
     links to be reproduced, in full, when the local file copy of the
     document is displayed later.  Also, if the document is refetched
     via http or https, the HTTP server provided "headers" sent ahead
     of the document will be placed in the local file copy.  Along with
     the &lt;BASE&nbsp;HREF="&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;"&gt; HTML tag
     introduced just above.  They will further document the file's
     remaining contents.  The document, itself, starts following the
     local file's first blank line.  An exception is made for the
     <A HREF="news:?">news:?</A> URL.  If that is the source of the
     document on display, nothing is added to the beginning of the
     local file copy made.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>This menu entry may be used for saving documents containing binary,
     MIME, UU, or yEncoded data in a transparent fashion.  If a "clean"
     copy of any document copied via this menu entry is desired, the local
     file copy written by DosLynx may be recopied with the DEHEAD utility
     provided.  It will copy everything in a file after its first blank
     line.  As <A HREF="news:?">news:?</A> documents are clean to begin
     with, they won't need DEHEAD processing.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Dos Shell (Ctrl-F10)
 <DD>The DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode version swaps most of itself out of memory
     unless shoswap=NO is specified in your DOSLYNX.CFG file.
     The DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode versions ignore the shoswap= option
     and swap most of their Real&nbsp;Mode portion(s) out of DOS memory.
     DosLynx (all versions) then spawns your command interpreter so that
     you may take action, from a DOS prompt inside of DosLynx, without
     having to exit.  Most DOS commands and programs will be accessible
     from this prompt.  In particular, you may issue driveletter: and
     CHDIR command(s) to change your current drive and directory.
     So as to simplify use of the DosLynx local file dialogs, which
     inherit these settings.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>However, you must refrain from loading a TSR or using the
     Packet Driver.  (Though, you may be able to use the Packet Driver if
     DosLynx hasn't used it, yet.  Or, you may be able to use another
     Packet Driver instance if you have already installed a Packet Mux..)
     If DosLynx is configured to use EMS for overlays and/or swapping, you
     also must avoid disrupting its EMS setup.  (The DosLynx
     Protected&nbsp;Mode versions don't use overlays nor the ems=
     configuration option.  Conceivably, they might use EMS for swapping.)
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Depending on limitation(s) of your DPMI service and how much memory
     you have available, running Protected&nbsp;Mode application(s) from
     within a DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode version may be tricky.
     Generally, trouble is sure to come if you try to mix
     Protected&nbsp;Mode programs with unmatched register sizes.
     Having both 16-bit and 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode versions of DosLynx
     available for use should help in avoiding many of these kinds of
     problems.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>After selecting this item, you should always EXIT the
     command interpreter, to return to DosLynx, after you are finished.
     (If shoswap=NO is specified in your DOSLYNX.CFG file and you are
     using the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode version, a lack of sufficient free
     memory may prevent you from successfully running the command(s) you
     issue.  An extreme lack of free memory may even prevent the DosLynx
     Real&nbsp;Mode version from successfully spawning your command
     interpreter.)
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Beginning with version&nbsp;0.24&nbsp;beta, DosLynx itself may be
     safely invoked from a DOS prompt inside of an already running
     instance of DosLynx.  Though, a limitation of your DPMI service
     and/or a lack of sufficient XMS memory may prevent this with the
     DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode versions.  When DosLynx is invoked while
     shelled-out from DosLynx, it won't remove any DosLynx temporary
     file(s) it finds at the beginning of its run.  And, it will issue
     a reminder message to this effect.  This usage may be of some
     value for performing local operations, which might be prevented
     by a lack of memory in the original DosLynx instance.
     However, you won't have any additional access to the Packet Driver
     without a Packet Mux. arrangement, as explained above.
     In the absence of a good reason for running another instance of
     DosLynx, it will always be better to return to your original
     DosLynx session by EXIT(ing) the command interpreter.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
File|Exit (Alt-X)
 <DD>This is the intended way for you to end your DosLynx session.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Find... (Alt-F4)
 <DD>Allows you to enter a Search&nbsp;String that DosLynx will find in
     your currently active window.  Beginning with DosLynx
     version&nbsp;0.24&nbsp;beta, this dialog provides both
     "Loose&nbsp;Find" and "Exact&nbsp;Find" buttons.  These initiate
     searches that use either case-insensitive or exact matching.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Find Again (F4)
 <DD>DosLynx will search for the next occurrence of the last
     Search&nbsp;String entered to the find command.  The search will
     continue using loose or exact matching, as specified when the last
     Search&nbsp;String was entered.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Next Anchor (J, 2, or Tab)
 <DD>This will move an internal anchor cursor to the next selectable
     anchor or Form control or object in the active window.  If the anchor
     is a reference or link containing a destination URL, or a Form
     control or object that isn't hidden, it will be highlighted.
     The highlight will go out if you move to an anchor that is only a name
     or label or to a hidden Form control or object.  This command will only
     be active when the document on view, in the active window, contains one
     or more anchor(s) or Form control(s) or object(s).
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Previous Anchor (K, 8, or Shift-Tab)
 <DD>This will move an internal anchor cursor to the previous selectable
     anchor or Form control or object in the active window.  If the anchor
     is a reference or link containing a destination URL, or a Form
     control or object that isn't hidden, it will be highlighted.
     The highlight will go out if you move to an anchor that is only a name
     or label or to a hidden Form control or object.  This command will only
     be active when the document on view, in the active window, contains one
     or more anchor(s) or Form control(s) or object(s).
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Reload Current (Alt-R)
 <DD>This entry or command provides for refreshing the present view.
     It is used to bypass the cache's operation when the present view is
     found to be defective or stale and needs to be reloaded.
     Beginning with DosLynx version&nbsp;0.26b, caching improvements have
     closed loopholes that allowed anchor following to provide a refresh,
     in some cases.  At the same time, this command's previous deficiencies
     were resolved.  If an HTTP Referer: field was sent in the request
     that obtained the present view, that will be repeated here.
     Unless HTTP Referer Mode has been turned off in the meantime.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Your most frequent need for this command may come whenever a lack of
     memory keeps the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode version from completing its
     presentation of a new document.  If you have followed a link, the
     linked-from document will have been freed or removed from memory.
     So, this command may then be able to reload the present document, in
     its entirety.  If the present document is from a local file beginning
     with a &lt;BASE&nbsp;HREF=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&gt; HTML tag,
     an attempt will be made to load it from its original source.
     That source is indicated on the window's top line.  The resulting
     view replaces the present view in the cache and the currently active
     window.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Download Selection (Alt-D)
 <DD>This is like File|Save&nbsp;Source except that the document to be
     saved in a local file is named by the destination URL of the
     currently selected anchor or Form Submit Button control.  Use this
     menu entry or command when you are about to link to a presentable
     document you know you'll want to save.  This will save you the
     refetch that will be needed if you should first simply follow the
     currently selected anchor.  This command may be indispensable for
     capturing the response to a Form's submission.  Also, it is
     recommended for saving documents, such as news: documents containing
     yEncoded data, known in advance to require transparent handling that
     they won't get by default.  For URLs other than
     <A HREF="news:?">news:?</A>, the local file copy that DosLynx writes
     is prefixed with a header that ends with a blank line.
     This is explained in more detail, for the File|Save&nbsp;Source menu
     entry, above.  If HTTP Referer Mode is Enabled and ON, the URL of
     the document containing the link being followed is sent in the HTTP
     request's Referer: Header field.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>This menu entry isn't the best for obtaining a clean local copy of
     a file, such as an .EXE, that isn't presentable.  Normally, simply
     selecting and activating such a file's anchor will accomplish that.
     However, this menu entry may be necessary to force saving if the
     file's server mis-classifies it as presentable.  When this menu entry
     is used to override a server's mis-classification, the saved object
     will begin with what is likely to be an undesired added header.
     In any event, object(s) already received by means of this menu entry
     may be cleaned or rid of an undesired added header by use of the
     DEHEAD utility.  It will copy everything in a file after its first
     blank line.  Downloaded <A HREF="news:?">news:?</A> files get
     written without a prefix and won't need DEHEADing.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Activate Anchor (L, 6, or Enter)
 <DD>This menu entry acts on the currently selected anchor or Form control
     or object in one of several ways.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>For anchors, causes DosLynx to attempt loading the anchor-specified
     destination URL.  URL loading is performed as described above for the
     File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry's Open button.  Except that when the
     specified document is presentable, its presentation replaces the
     present view in the currently active window.  Any Form content or data
     that has been entered into the replaced view gets lost at this point.
     If HTTP Referer Mode is Enabled and ON, the URL of the document
     containing the link being followed is sent in the HTTP request's
     Referer: Header field.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>For Form password and text line input objects, invokes a line
     input/editing dialog.  This line input/editing dialog will be
     provided with a Submit Button when the containing Form lacks a
     Submit Button control.  For Form textarea objects, invokes a TMemo
     input/editing dialog.  Beginning with DosLynx
     version&nbsp;0.31&nbsp;beta, this dialog offers a Paste File push
     button.  This button provides for reading text file(s) into the
     TMemo object being composed.  For Form select input objects, invokes
     a list box input selection dialog.  For Form checkbox and radio
     button objects, causes DosLynx to toggle the object's state,
     if possible.  (Radio buttons only respond when they're in the
     unpushed or unset state.  When a radio button does respond to
     activation, it replaces the already pushed button, in the same
     group, that then gets popped back out.)  For Form submit and reset
     button controls, the labeled action gets performed.  That is, the
     Form's content or data gets submitted or reset.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Form content or data submission is like URL loading in that a
     document is expected in response.  However, it differs with
     respect to where the response document is presented and what
     happens to any Form content or data that has been entered into the
     current document.  The document obtained in response to Form content
     or data submission is loaded exactly as described above for the
     File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry's Open button.  That is, when this
     document is presentable, it is presented in a new window.
     This allows the Form content or data that has been entered into the
     submitted document to be preserved in what becomes the previously
     active window.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>The Navigate|Activate&nbsp;Anchor command will not be active when
     the document on display, in the currently active window, contains no
     anchor(s) nor Form control(s).  This will be the case for text files
     and a few (usually short) HTML documents.  (ERROR.HTM provides an
     obvious example.)  Also, it will not be active when the currently
     selected anchor carries no destination URL.  Or, when the currently
     selected Form object is one that is "hidden".
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Prior Document (H or 4)
 <DD>This will cause DosLynx to attempt to return to the last visited
     presentable URL, if any, in the currently active window.
     This command will only be active when there are one or more Prior
     Document(s) associated with the currently active window.
     In many cases, the prior document may be available from the DosLynx
     cache.  If so, the document won't need to be refetched from its
     original source.  If the document does need to be refetched and if
     an HTTP Referer: field was sent in the request that last obtained it,
     that will be repeated here.  Unless HTTP Referer Mode has been turned
     OFF in the meantime.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Go To (Alt-G)
 <DD>This command was added to DosLynx in version&nbsp;0.29b.  It provides
     you with a list of the URL(s) that have been presented and are still
     pending in the currently active window.  You may select any one of
     the listed URL(s) to be operated on by one of the dialog's push
     buttons.  The Go&nbsp;Back button takes the currently active window
     back to the selected URL.  As if the Navigate|Prior&nbsp;Document
     command had been used as many times as necessary to return to it.
     The Go&nbsp;Back button will save time when there are intermediate
     view(s) that you don't care to revisit.  The Go&nbsp;Again button
     presents the selected URL in a new window.  Just as if it had been
     entered into the File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry or command.
     The Paste button copies the selected URL into the
     File|Open&nbsp;URL... dialog's history.  From there, it may be
     edited and/or presented in a new window or downloaded.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>The Navigate|Go&nbsp;To command displays only the first
     250&nbsp;characters of longer URLs.  And, that length limit is
     enforced by the Paste button's operation.  However, the
     Go&nbsp;Back and Go&nbsp;Again buttons operate on an unlimited
     internal copy of the selected URL.  So, they may be used without
     concern for the selected URL's length.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Search Index... (F7)
 <DD>Some HTML documents provide interfaces for searchable indexes.
     These documents contain the HTML
     &lt;ISINDEX&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&gt; tag and are known,
     somewhat imprecisely, as "searchable documents".
     To request a search of the index associated with the currently
     active window's present document, select this command.  In turn,
     you'll get a simple dialog for entering your search string.
     This command will only be active if the currently active window's
     present document provides an interface to a searchable index.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>The Navigate|Search&nbsp;Index... command complements or
     contrasts with the DosLynx Navigate|Find&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
     commands.  The Search command's search is performed, by the
     document's server, upon an index or database that it maintains.
     Meanwhile, the Find commands' search is performed, by DosLynx
     itself, upon the loaded document.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Navigate|Show Destination URL (Alt-U)
 <DD>This selection reports on the type of, and the destination URL
     specified by, the currently selected anchor or Form control or
     object.  The first line of this command's report contains a
     brief description of the selected object's type.  In the case
     of a document such as a text file that contains no selectable
     object(s), Object&nbsp;Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;none will be reported.
     In the case of an anchor selection that has no destination URL,
     Object&nbsp;Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;Label will be reported.
     For Form controls which consist of or include a Submit Button,
     the first line ends with an indication of whether a GET or POST
     request will be used for Form submission.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>The remainder of this command's report displays a destination
     URL, a destination URL equivalent, or destination URL-like
     internal data.  For anchors or Hyperlinks, this is a
     destination URL.  For Form control objects which consist of or
     include Submit Buttons, this is a URL equivalent composed of
     the Form's present data content appended to the &lt;FORM tag's
     ACTION=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. URL.  This is the URL that will be
     transmitted if the Submit Button should be activated.
     Except, for Submit Buttons using a POST request, the indicated
     URL equivalent will be split, at its last question mark
     character, into URL and data parts.  For Form select input
     controls, this is a destination URL-like representation of the
     control's presently selected option.  For other Form control
     objects, this is a destination URL-like representation of the
     control's initial data, if any.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Beginning with DosLynx version&nbsp;0.29b, the
     Navigate|Show&nbsp;Destination&nbsp;URL command's dialog will
     include a Paste push button, whenever it has a URL or URL-like
     value to report.  This button copies up to 250&nbsp;characters
     from the beginning of the displayed URL into the
     File|Open&nbsp;URL... dialog's history.  From there, the pasted
     URL may be edited and/or presented in a new window or downloaded.
     This dialog's other button(s) simply provide a variety of ways
     for dismissing the dialog.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Options|Manage HTTP Cookie Mode
 <DD>Beginning with DosLynx version&nbsp;0.34b, this item provides a
     short report or dialog pertaining to the status of HTTP Cookie Mode.
     Most of this status comes from the cookiedir= and cookiemode=
     configuration items.  They are described by comments in the sample
     DOSLYNX.CFG file provided.  HTTP Cookie Mode pertains to whether
     HTTP Cookie(s) are being accepted from received HTTP Set-Cookie:
     Header fields.  To whether they are also being sent back in HTTP
     Cookie: Header fields, in DosLynx GET and POST requests.
     And, to whether this receiving and sending is being audited by
     messages to the Messages window.  HTTP Cookie Mode also includes
     a Monitoring state.  In this state, received HTTP Set-Cookie:
     Header fields are reported by messages to the Messages window.
     However, the Cookie(s) these Header fields carry are then discarded
     without being used to update a DosLynx Cookie(s) file.
     If HTTP Cookie Mode Auditing is Enabled or HTTP Cookie Mode is
     Enabled, this dialog also provides a Change Mode push button for
     stepping through the two or three available ON/Monitoring/OFF
     states configured.  While HTTP Cookie Mode is Enabled and ON,
     Cookies received in Set-Cookie: Header fields are used to update
     DosLynx Cookie files.  Appropriate unexpired Cookies selected from
     these files are then sent back in Cookie: Header fields, in
     DosLynx GET and POST requests.  This dialog's OK button simply
     provides for dismissing the dialog.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Options|Manage HTTP Referer Mode
 <DD>Beginning with DosLynx version&nbsp;0.32b, this item provides a
     short report or dialog pertaining to the status of HTTP Referer
     Mode.  Most of this status comes from the refmode= configuration
     item.  That is described by comments in the sample DOSLYNX.CFG
     file provided.  HTTP Referer Mode pertains to whether the HTTP
     Referer: Header field is being sent in GET and POST requests.
     And, to whether this sending is being audited by messages to the
     Messages window.  If HTTP Referer Mode is configured to be Enabled,
     this dialog also provides a Change Mode push button for toggling
     its ON/OFF status.  While HTTP Referer Mode is Enabled and ON,
     the Referer: field will be sent in request Headers, whenever a
     Referer URL is available.  This dialog's OK button simply provides
     for dismissing the dialog.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Options|Toggle Low/High Text Mode
 <DD>Allows you to switch back and forth between the default 25 line
     text mode and the 43 or 50 line text mode of EGA or VGA video
     adapters.  If there is no 43 or 50 line text mode available for
     your video adapter, this command will leave your display unchanged.
     This is the case with the Hercules video adapter.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Options|Send Mail
 <DD>Presents a dialog window for composing and sending a short e-mail
     note.  Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.27b, the Send Mail window's
     To: line will accept a short list of comma separated e-mail
     addresses.  You are free to use leading or trailing space(s)
     around your e-mail address(es) to improve the list's appearance.
     However, you need to keep the entire line to a length of less
     than 256 characters.  The text of your note will have to be kept
     to a length of less than 4096 characters.
<DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.31b, the Send Mail dialog includes
     a Paste File push button.  This button may be used to specify
     short text file(s) to be read into the note being composed.
     At the end of each file read operation, invoked from the Send Mail
     dialog, a simple Confirm dialog provides a pause for your review
     of the Messages window.  When you are ready, any of the usual
     responses will take you back to the Send Mail dialog.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Messages (Alt-M)
 <DD>This will cause the window containing all of the DosLynx messages
     to become the currently active window.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Clone Window
 <DD>Use this if you wish to create a duplicate of the currently active
     document window and all of its views.  The new window is expected
     to be the same in every respect except for window number and size.
     Any entered Form content or data present in the currently active
     window's present view will be maintained and should be faithfully
     copied into the new window's present view.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Zoom In/Out (F5)
 <DD>Use this command to switch the active or selected window to its
     maximum possible size.  Or, to return it to its previous size,
     before Zoom.  The document presentation windows start out at maximum
     size unless a Window|Cascade or Window|Tile command has been used.
     So, they usually aren't Zoom(able).  On the other hand, the Messages
     window starts out minimized and is always Zoom(able).
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Resize (Alt-F5)
 <DD>This command provides for adjusting the currently active window's
     size and position.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Next (F6)
 <DD>This command gives another window, from the list of open windows,
     a turn at being the currently active window.  If and when you get
     disoriented while using DosLynx, the F6 key is handy for stepping
     through and reviewing all your open window(s).
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Cascade
 <DD>Use this command to organize all open document presentation
     windows in a cascading arrangement on your display.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Tile
 <DD>Use this command to organize all open document presentation
     windows in a tiled arrangement on your display.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Window|Close (F3)
 <DD>This command duplicates the File|Close command.  It closes the
     currently active window, making the memory allocated to that
     window a candidate for reuse.  Once closed, windows other than
     the Messages window become unviewable.  The Esc key provides
     a short-cut for closing the Messages window.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Hotlist|View... (F1)
 <DD>This command causes DosLynx to load the configuration file
     specified Hotlist file, for easy access to anchors you've saved.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Hotlist|Add Current To Hotlist (Alt-A)
 <DD>This command will add the URL of the currently active window
     to your Hotlist file.  In addition, it will prompt you for a name or
     title by which to remember the URL.  Once you've entered that name
     or title, the Hotlist file will be updated.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Hotlist|Add Link To Hotlist (Alt-T)
 <DD>This command will add the destination URL specified by the
     currently selected anchor to your Hotlist file.
     This provides a way to make a long term copy of content or data
     that has been entered into a Form being submitted.
     After you've completed the name or title dialog for the new entry,
     the Hotlist file will be updated.  (You'll need to edit your
     Hotlist file with another program to remove any of its entries.)
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Hotlist|Home Page (F9)
 <DD>Use this command to open a new window loaded with the configuration
     file specified home page.

Help|About DosLynx
 <DD>Provides DosLynx version and authors information.  Reach this menu
     entry by pulling-down another menu and then using arrow key(s) to
     move to the Help menu.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Help|Mail Developer
 <DD>Use this command to send a suggestion or bug report to the
     developer of DosLynx, if you are connected to a network.
     This menu entry works just like Options|Send&nbsp;Mail, except
     that the To: and Subject: lines are appropriately filled-in before
     you start.  You may edit these entries, if you like, even though
     they aren't blank when you start.  Reach this menu entry by
     pulling-down another menu and then using arrow key(s) to move to
     the Help menu.
<DT>&nbsp;
</DL>

DosLynx also has many other ways of obtaining user input.<p>

Most available hotkey or Short-Cut key equivalents are listed beside the
menu choices in the DosLynx menus.<p>

In addition to the keys listed in the menus, you can use several other keys
for anchor navigation.  These are:  Tab and Shifted&nbsp;Tab, the
UNIX&nbsp;vi keys (hjkl), your numeric keypad with Num&nbsp;Lock&nbsp;ON,
and the top row numeric 2, 4, 6, and 8 keys.  Even though you have
Num&nbsp;Lock&nbsp;ON, you interpret the numeric keypad keys in terms of
the arrows they also carry.  (This differs from the version&nbsp;0.7a
release of DosLynx, that allowed the user to use the Lynx arrow keys for
anchor navigation.  That is no&nbsp;longer supported.)  The off-keypad
arrow keys are now reserved for scrolling, only.  If you have an original
PC keyboard, without off-keypad arrow keys, you'll probably want to leave
Num&nbsp;Lock&nbsp;OFF.  So you can use the keypad's arrow keys for
scrolling.  In that case, you'll need to learn to use Tab, Shift-Tab,
hjkl, and/or some of the top row numeric keys for anchor navigation.<p>

Keys we'll call "the scrolling keys" all provide for you to look through
a document that is longer than your display.  These are:  The numeric
keypad's End, PgDn, Home, and PgUp keys (with Num&nbsp;Lock&nbsp;ON).
The top row numeric 1, 3, 7, and 9 keys.  The off-keypad Page&nbsp;Down,
Page&nbsp;Up, and arrow keys.  And, the Space Bar.
The off-keypad End, Page&nbsp;Down, Home, Page&nbsp;Up, and arrow keys
also provide for moving and scrolling within list box and other input
control dialogs.  Ctrl-Page&nbsp;Down and Ctrl-Page&nbsp;Up
(and, the numeric keypad's Ctrl-PgDn and Ctrl-PgUp, with
Num&nbsp;Lock&nbsp;OFF) provide alternatives to 1 and 7, for moving to
the end and beginning of a document or list box.<p>

Esc closes the Messages window and cancels other dialog windows.
This is equivalent to pressing a dialog's cancel button.  In a dialog
with multiple buttons along the bottom, the cancel button is always the
right-most one.  Esc also provides a "break" or "abort" key,  within the
Messages window, when DosLynx is busy preparing a document's presentation.
It interrupts any TCP/IP reception, parsing, or formatting process that
may be underway.  After TCP/IP reception and/or parsing gets interrupted,
DosLynx will move on to its formatting process.  So, hit Esc again, then,
if you want to cancel that, too.  Esc doesn't close the document
presentation window(s), however.<p>

Enter pushes the selected (if any) or default button in dialog windows.
In a dialog with multiple buttons along the bottom, the default button
is always the left-most one.  Enter activates links or Form input dialogs
in document presentation windows.  And, it activates the currently
selected menu entry in menus.<p>

Space pushes the selected button in dialog windows.  And, it moves down
a screen in document presentation windows.  In the Messages window, a
Space&nbsp;Bar tap provides a safe way to check to see if DosLynx is busy
with anything.<p>

Alt-n, where n is an open window number digit, from the keyboard's
top row, quickly makes window n the currently active window.<p>

The TMemo editor provides a text selection feature to facilitate
clipping away large text areas.  Text may be selected by moving the
cursor, with arrow key(s), while holding a Shift key down.
Or, by moving the mouse while holding either of its buttons down.
Then, a Backspace or Del(ete) key will delete all of the selected text.
If a mistake is made while selecting text, an un-shifted arrow key may
be used to remove any selection present.  Also, Shift and Ctrl-Shift
combinations with the Page&nbsp;Up, Page&nbsp;Down, PgUp, and PgDn keys
provide special selections.  Shift-Page&nbsp;Up and Shift-PgUp select
all of the text from the top of the screen to the character ahead of
the cursor.  While, Ctrl-Shift-Page&nbsp;Up and Ctrl-Shift-PgUp select
all of the text from the very beginning of the edited data to the
character ahead of the cursor.  Similarly, Shift-Page&nbsp;Down and
Shift-PgDn select all of the text from the cursor to the bottom of the
screen.  While, Ctrl-Shift-Page&nbsp;Down and Ctrl-Shift-PgDn select
all of the text from the cursor to the very end of the edited data.<p>

If you use a mouse with DosLynx, you can select an anchor or Form input
control by using a single left button click.  And, you can activate an
anchor or Form input control by using a double left button click.
Prior to DosLynx&nbsp;v0.27b, a special case arose when attempting to
select an inline image which also has a destination.  That is, an inline
image nested within an anchor.  That special case has been eliminated.
See the <A HREF="#SpecialNotes">Special Notes</A> section.<p>

Items contained in the status bar (the bottom line of your screen while
running DosLynx) are selectable by the mouse only but correlate directly
with items in the Navigate menu.  These items will be bright or dim to
indicate whether the indicated menu entries or commands are currently
available or active, or not.  In addition, the right mouse button is the
same as issuing the Window|Clone&nbsp;Window command.<p>

<H2><A NAME="SpecialNotes">Special Notes on Usage</A></H2>

As of the DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b release, only the following URL types are
supported:
<PRE>
	file
	ftp
	http
        https *
	mailto
	news
&nbsp;
*  https is supported only by the DosLynx 32-bit Protected Mode version.
&nbsp;
</PRE>

Prior to DosLynx&nbsp;v0.27b, when attempting to select an inline image
with a mouse, you might not have gotten what you expected.  Some inline
images also have destinations, in which case you would be taken to that
destination.  You needed to use the keyboard to select an inline image
which also had a destination.  Starting with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.27b, such
nested inline images are given their own visible place holders.
That allows their access via the mouse, just like unnested inline images.<p>

For best DosLynx performance, specify the temporary file directory in
your configuration file or on the command line to be a directory on a
RAMDRIVE.  But, only consider this if you have more than two&nbsp;MB of
EMS or XMS memory available, for the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode version.
If you are using either DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b Protected&nbsp;Mode version,
don't consider a RAMDRIVE unless you have at least eight&nbsp;MB of RAM
available.  If you have only a relatively small quantity of EMS or XMS
memory available, there are a couple of ways that DosLynx can use that,
without a RAMDRIVE.  First, the DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b Real&nbsp;Mode version
can make good use of up to about 320&nbsp;KB (20&nbsp;EMS pages) of this
memory, for holding its overlays.  Specify the ems= and/or xms=
configuration option(s) to enable this usage.  Also, if you have EMS or
XMS memory available, DosLynx will be able to use over 500&nbsp;KB more
of that, without a RAMDRIVE.  When it swaps itself out of standard memory
for running DLXVIEW or DOS commands.  DosLynx is able to run successfully,
though somewhat slowly, without any EMS or XMS memory available.
See your DOS documentation for setting up a RAMDRIVE specific to your
system.<p>

DosLynx is a multiple document interface (MDI) application.
This may confuse new users that are used to other World Wide Web clients.
Remember:  Using the File|Open&nbsp;URL... (with its Open button) or
File|Open&nbsp;Local... menu items or equivalent hotkeys, or submitting a
Form, leads to opening a new window.  Whenever the opened URL or document
or Form submission's response is presentable.  The first nine windows are
numbered in their upper right corners.  You can switch among these windows
by pressing the Alt key and the window number simultaneously.  All windows
can be reached via the Window|Next menu entry or its F6 key short-cut.<p>

Each open window usually represents at least one open temporary file.
If you try to open more windows than you have FILES specified in your
CONFIG.SYS file, DosLynx will shut down.  If you have at least FILES=20
specified, however, this may not be a problem.  Because, with the DosLynx
Real&nbsp;Mode version, you'll tend to run out of memory at about the same
time as you hit the open FILES limit.  With the DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode
versions, you'll have to be a little more careful.  A good way to handle
this is to avoid opening another new window once you have all nine of the
numbered windows open.  So, make sure you have at least FILES=20 specified
in your CONFIG.SYS file.  There may be little to be gained from specifying
more than FILES=20, without taking additional measures.<p>

When the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode version has used most of your computer's
memory, the File|Dos&nbsp;Shell command will not work, if DOSLYNX.CFG
contains shoswap=NO.  Your computer simply does not have enough standard
DOS memory to execute your command interpreter.  By default, shoswap=YES,
enabling DosLynx to swap most of itself out of memory, to avoid this
problem.<p>

When you ftp a file or activate an anchor that DosLynx cannot display as
text, you are asked to give a file name to save the information in.
A filename may be suggested by DosLynx.  These files are not removed by
DosLynx when you exit the application.  This allows you as the user to do
what you will with such files after exiting DosLynx.  However, presently,
DosLynx does not consider existing files in making its suggestion.
If you are prompted to save a file that is already on your disk, consider
using another name before letting the file you already have be
over-written.<p>

When DosLynx terminates unexpectedly, the temporary file(s) it has opened
may remain in the temporary file directory you specified in the
configuration file or on the command line.  The temporary file names
follow the pattern of DL*.$$$.  You no longer have to remove these files
yourself unless you are very low on disk space, however.  Beginning with
version&nbsp;0.20&nbsp;beta, DosLynx removes any of these files it finds,
at the beginning of each run, to keep them from accumulating.<p>

Beginning with version&nbsp;0.24&nbsp;beta, there is an exception to the
preceding rule.  DosLynx now checks to see if another instance of DosLynx
is already running.  (That will be the case if you run DosLynx while
shelled out of DosLynx to a DOS command prompt.)  If so, it refrains from
removing any temporary file(s).  That restraint is necessary to keep from
destroying the already running instance of DosLynx!  DosLynx issues a
reminder message when it decides not to remove any temporary file(s).<p>

If you are wondering, the menu bar contains the current time in the upper
right hand corner.  In the status bar are three numbers in the lower right
corner.  These numbers are, from left to right:  The current network
activity in bytes.  The free space in bytes on the temporary drive you
specified.  And, the amount of available heap memory in bytes.
These were originally run-time debugging tools for the developer of DosLynx.
They were left in as they are now harmless and give the user useful
information on what is happening while DosLynx is at work.
They can be turned off with the /B command line option, if desired.
The /U command line option also turns off the rightmost two of these three
numbers.<p>

To force DosLynx into a supported black and white video mode, type<br>
C:\DOSINET>mode BW80<br>
at your DOS prompt.  Consider doing this if you monitor is black and white
but DosLynx considers it a color monitor (monochrome EGA monitors).
Anchor text, selected anchor text, and text located by the
Navigate|Find&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. commands should all be distinguishable
from normal text and each other, on your monitor.  If that isn't the case
with your monitor, take a look at the contrast= configuration value added
to DosLynx in version&nbsp;0.29b.  It should be able to provide you with a
display attribute table selection that provides the needed contrasts, with
your monitor.  Use of the contrast= configuration value is explained by
extensive comments in the DOSLYNX.CFG file.<p>

If you have severe trouble with your mouse driver, check into the mouse=
configuration value added to DosLynx in version&nbsp;0.32b.  Such trouble
might take the form of a DosLynx crash the first time you move the mouse,
in a DosLynx session.  This trouble might come for only one of the three
DosLynx versions.  mouse= configuration allows you to tell the DosLynx
Real&nbsp;Mode version or Protected&nbsp;Mode versions, or all three, to
ignore your mouse driver.  That will prevent the kind of crash pictured
above.<p>

If you have an older (read:  slower) PC, you'll probably wish for better
performance from DosLynx from time-to-time.  Here are a few more things
you can do to speed it up:<BR>
<DL>
<DT>
Forgo a Home File
 <DD>Use loadhome=OFF in DOSLYNX.CFG, /HOFF on the command line, or give
     the home= configuration option the name of a short or empty file.
     This will save the time needed to display INFO.HTM each time you
     start DosLynx.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Remove All the Comments From DOSLYNX.CFG
 <DD>Once you are satisfied with your configuration and are sure that you
     have backup copies of it, go through DOSLYNX.CFG and remove all of
     the comment lines.  Again, this will save time each time you start
     DosLynx.  Shortening DOSLYNX.CFG also saves time upon the first use
     of TCP/IP communication in each DosLynx session.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Keep the Directories You Use Frequently Short
 <DD>DosLynx can take a few seconds to develop a local file dialog box
     on a PC-XT, when the present DOS directory contains hundreds of
     entries.  If you can keep the directories you use the most
     relatively short, you'll save time each time you invoke a local file
     dialog.
<DT>&nbsp;
<DT>
Don't Configure debugen=ON
 <DD>If DosLynx is slow in shutting-down, make sure you don't have
     debugen=ON specified in DOSLYNX.CFG.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="NewFeatures">New DosLynx Features</A></H2>

The following new features have been added to DosLynx, in releases
beginning with DosLynx version&nbsp;0.20&nbsp;beta:<BR>
<DL>
 <DT>&lt;BASE&nbsp;HREF=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&gt; tags<DD>
     DosLynx now honors these tags when they appear in HTML.  They also
     are provided to local files written by the File|Open&nbsp;URL...
     (with its Download button), File|Save&nbsp;Source, and
     Navigate|Download&nbsp;Selection menu entries.  These provisions
     enable relative URLs to be properly reproduced when the local
     files are later viewed.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>&lt;META&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&gt; tags<DD>
     DosLynx is now also displaying many of these tags when they appear
     in HTML.
     &lt;META&nbsp;HTTP-EQUIV=REFRESH CONTENT=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&gt;
     tags specifying URLs are now treated like anchors, too.
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.26b, a showmetas= configuration option
     controls the display of most &lt;META&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&gt;
     tags, along with two other forms of meta content.  These things are
     described in some detail by comments in the provided sample
     DOSLYNX.CFG file.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Temporary Files<DD>At startup, DosLynx will now remove any of its
     own temporary files that it finds abandoned in the configured
     temporary directory.  Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.24b, this action
     will be withheld when DosLynx detects another instance of itself
     already running.  In that case, a reminder message will be issued.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Unexpected Shut Downs<DD>DosLynx will now pause to give its user
     15 seconds to read its final messages before exiting.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Swap Out for Graphics Viewing and Escape to DOS Shell<DD>DosLynx
     will now swap most of itself out of main memory, to XMS or EMS memory
     or a temporary file, before invoking DLXVIEW to display a graphic file.
     If shoswap=NO is not configured, DosLynx also will swap most of itself
     out of main memory, to XMS or EMS memory or a temporary file, before
     shelling out to DOS.  The shoswap=NO configuration option is ignored
     by the DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode versions and is mainly a debug tool.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Intra-Session History Added<DD>The present view's current top line
     and currently selected anchor will be noted when an anchor is activated.
     i.e.:  When a link is followed.  Upon return, or a linked-from view's
     reinstatement, the noted top line position and anchor selection will be
     restored to the reinstated view.  Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.32&nbsp;beta, the Intra-Session History also includes
     each document's Referer URL, if any.  That provides for resending the
     HTTP Referer: field if a document needs refetching when it gets
     reinstated.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>debugen= Configuration Option Added<DD>The debugen= configuration option
     enables heapcheck(ing) while DosLynx shuts down.  heapcheck( ) discovers
     heap corruption resulting from certain kinds of software errors.
     Configuring debugen=ON may help to avoid crashing during shut-down.
     However, it is a luxury that probably isn't affordable on slower PCs.
     (Shut-down can take as long as 45 minutes on a PC-XT with debugen=ON!)
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.24b, the debugen= configuration option
     also enables a detailed trace of the DosLynx/server dialog that occurs
     during a DosLynx ftp access.  This may help you discover what is going
     wrong if and when an ftp access fails repeatedly.  The default value
     for debugen= is OFF.  Possible values are OFF and ON.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Messages Window Now Pops Up Over ERROR.HTM<DD>Beginning with
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.22b, the Messages window will pop up over ERROR.HTM
     whenever it is presented as the result of a problem.  This saves you
     from having to fumble around to see your messages after a problem has
     been encountered.  The Esc key now provides a one key way to dismiss
     the Messages window.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>DEHEAD Utility Now Provided with DosLynx<DD>Beginning with
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.22b, the DosLynx release package includes the DEHEAD
     utility program.  It provides for removing the headers that DosLynx
     adds to the local copies of files written via the File|Open&nbsp;URL...
     (with its Download button), File|Save&nbsp;Source, and
     Navigate|Download&nbsp;Selection menu entries.  It will copy everything
     in a file after its first blank line.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT><A HREF="NEWSURLS.HTM">NEWSURLS.HTM</A> Now Provided with DosLynx<DD>
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.22b, the DosLynx release package
     includes a description of the news URLs that DosLynx accepts, in
     <A HREF="NEWSURLS.HTM">NEWSURLS.HTM</A>.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Forms Support Added to DosLynx<DD>DosLynx&nbsp;v0.24b brought an
     initial installment of Forms support.  Implemented, here, are the
     HTML &lt;FORM&nbsp;METHOD=get&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
     &lt;INPUT&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tags -- for input TYPEs checkbox,
     hidden, password, radio, reset, submit, and text.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>DosLynx&nbsp;v0.25b brought two more Form input controls.
     These support the HTML &lt;SELECT&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
     &lt;INPUT&nbsp;TYPE=image&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tags.  (The former
     supports neither MULTIPLE nor SIZE= attributes.  The latter is
     implemented as a combination of an HTML &lt;IMG&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
     tag and an &lt;INPUT&nbsp;TYPE=submit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tag.
     It doesn't provide any cursor coordinate data.)
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>DosLynx&nbsp;v0.27b brought support for the HTML
     &lt;TEXTAREA&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tag or Form input control.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>DosLynx&nbsp;v0.28b brought support for the HTML
     &lt;FORM&nbsp;METHOD=POST&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. variation, at last.
     You should now find that you have full read/write access to many of
     the Web's numerous Forum type sites.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>DosLynx&nbsp;v0.31b brought a Paste File push button for the
     Textarea Form input control or dialog.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>News Client Support for yEncoded Data<DD>Beginning with 
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.24b, the File|Save&nbsp;Source and
     Navigate|Download&nbsp;Selection menu entries will provide transparent
     handling for news: documents containing yEncoded data.
     The File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry's Download button, added in
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.25b, will provide this transparent handling, as well.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Loose Find Added to DosLynx<DD>Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.24b,
     the Navigate|Find... dialog will provide two push buttons for
     starting a search.  An "Exact Find" button will provide a search using
     exact matching.  This is the only mode previously offered.
     In addition, a "Loose Find" button will now provide a search using case
     insensitive (loose) matching.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>swapmem= Configuration Option Added<DD>Beginning with
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.24b, the swapmem= configuration option will determine
     whether or not any access is made to EMS and/or XMS memory for swapping
     DosLynx out of standard DOS memory.  This option is intended to provide
     a bypass for problem(s) encountered with the EMS and/or XMS services in
     some installations.  swapmem= need not be configured unless one
     suspects they are having trouble in this area.  (The symptoms of such
     a problem may be that DosLynx misbehaves when resumed after a swap
     out.)  swapmem= is specified in terms of the memory services that SWAP
     is allowed to access.  Possible values are:  Both (same as default,
     starting with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.22b -- SWAP accesses XMS memory, and then
     EMS memory if necessary).  EMS (SWAP accesses EMS, but not XMS, memory).
     XMS (same as provided in DosLynx&nbsp;v0.20b -- SWAP accesses XMS, but
     not EMS, memory).  And, Neither (SWAP only accesses the disk).
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>HTML &lt;IMAGE&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tags<DD>Beginning with
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.24b, &lt;IMAGE will be recognized in HTML as a synonym
     for the &lt;IMG tag.  This is necessary to support apparently
     non-standard HTML that is recognized by Internet Explorer and used at
     http://www.microsoft.com .  For an example of this, see:
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows98/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wufeatured/win98se/">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows98/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wufeatured/win98se/</A>
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>DHCP Client Support Added<DD>Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.25b,
     my_ip=DHCP will be recognized in DOSLYNX.CFG for obtaining TCP/IP 
     configuration information from a DHCP server.  This has been
     implemented so as to avoid any change in the operation of the
     existing my_ip=BOOTP support, when that is configured.
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.39b, my_ip=EDHCP also will be
     recognized, for obtaining TCP/IP configuration information from a
     DHCP server that wants to know a little more about DosLynx.
     When my_ip=(E)DHCP is configured, mss= must specify 576 or more or
     be allowed to default (to 1400).  Comments in DOSLYNX.CFG provide
     more on these things.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.38b, Client-Identifier,
     IP&nbsp;Address&nbsp;Lease&nbsp;Time, and
     Vendor&nbsp;Class&nbsp;Identifier DHCP Option fields will be
     included in the DosLynx DHCP Discover message.  These seem to be
     needed to satisfy recent DHCP server implementations.
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.39b, these fields only will be
     included in the DosLynx DHCP Discover message sent as a result of
     my_ip=EDHCP configuration.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>File|Open URL... Download Button Added<DD>Beginning with 
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.25b, the File|Open&nbsp;URL... dialog will contain a
     Download button, in addition to Open (formerly OK) and Cancel buttons.
     The new Download button provides for File|Save&nbsp;Source or
     Navigate|Download&nbsp;Selection type handling for directly entered
     URLs.  The Open button remains the File|Open&nbsp;URL... dialog's
     default and operates just as the former OK button did.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Navigate|Go To Menu Entry Added<DD>Beginning with
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.29b, the Navigate|Go&nbsp;To command will provide
     for accessing or reusing all of the URL(s) visited and still pending
     in each open window.  This command's dialog provides push buttons
     for the following three actions:  Use the Go&nbsp;Back button to return
     to a selected URL.  This allows one or more intermediate views to
     be bypassed, for saving time in returning.  Use the Go&nbsp;Again
     button to open a selected URL in a new window.  Or, use the Paste
     button to paste a selected URL into the File|Open&nbsp;URL... dialog's
     history.  From there, the pasted URL may be edited and/or used for
     opening a new window or downloading.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Navigate|Show Destination URL Paste Button Added<DD>Beginning with
     DosLynx&nbsp;v0.29b, the Navigate|Show&nbsp;Destination&nbsp;URL
     command will provide a push button for pasting the anchor it is
     reporting into the File|Open&nbsp;URL... dialog's history.
     That saves you from having to type in an anchor you want to edit
     for use.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Support for Monochrome Monitors Improved<DD>A fourth display
     attribute table and the contrast= configuration option were added
     to DosLynx in version&nbsp;0.29b.  These provide improved contrast
     for what have been troublesome monochrome video adapters or
     monitors.  See the DOSLYNX.CFG file for more information on the new
     contrast= configuration option.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode Version Released<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.30&nbsp;beta, DosLynx will be offered in both its
     traditional Real&nbsp;Mode version and in a 16-bit
     Protected&nbsp;Mode version.  If your system can be equipped with a
     DOS&nbsp;Protected&nbsp;Mode&nbsp;Interface (or, DPMI) service, you
     will be able to run either version.  The DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b 16-bit
     Protected&nbsp;Mode version has about nine times as much memory, as
     the Real&nbsp;Mode version, to work with.  (Over 2.3&nbsp;MB versus
     about 250&nbsp;KB.)  This extra memory virtually eliminates the
     inability to completely present some very large documents, still
     present in the Real&nbsp;Mode version.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Beginning with version&nbsp;0.36&nbsp;beta, DosLynx will also be
     offered in a 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version.
     The DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version has about
     eight times as much memory, as the Real&nbsp;Mode version, to work
     with.  (Over 2.0&nbsp;MB versus about 250&nbsp;KB.)  The DPMI
     usually doesn't provide for using combinations of Protected&nbsp;Mode
     programs with unmatched register sizes.  So, having both 16-bit and
     32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode versions gives you added flexibility for
     using DosLynx together with other Protected&nbsp;Mode software.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD><A HREF="DPMIREVU.HTM">DPMIREVU.HTM</A>, reports on DPMI serving
     software with which DosLynx has been tested.  It is included in the
     DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode Add-On Package.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>SMTP AUTH LOGIN Support Added<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.31&nbsp;beta, the DosLynx e-mail client provides
     optional SMTP AUTH LOGIN support.  Supplying the new b64usrid=
     configuration option together with the new b64passw= configuration
     option or the new /S command line option enables this support.
     Without SMTP AUTH LOGIN enabled, the DosLynx e-mail client sends
     a HELO command, to initiate a session with the configured SMTP
     server.  With SMTP AUTH LOGIN enabled, an EHLO command will be
     sent.  The e-mail client attempts SMTP AUTH LOGIN when AUTH LOGIN
     is found "advertised" in the server's response to the EHLO command.
     Failed SMTP AUTH LOGIN attempt(s) prevent sending mail and get
     reported in the DosLynx Messages window.  SMTP AUTH LOGIN is
     discussed in at least two other sections of this document.
     (Use Navigate|Find... and specify SMTP to find those sections.)
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Paste File Buttons Added<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.31&nbsp;beta, the DosLynx Send Mail and
     Form Textarea TMemo dialogs contain Paste File push buttons.
     These provide for reading text file(s) into the note or text
     (TMemo object) being composed.  Further editing may be performed
     on such text file(s) data after it has been read.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Mouse Driver Configuration<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.32&nbsp;beta, DosLynx provides a mouse= configuration
     value.  This allows you to tell the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode version or
     Protected&nbsp;Mode versions, or all three, to ignore your installed
     mouse driver.  That provides a bypass for a severely problematic
     mouse driver.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>HTTP Referer: Header Field Support<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.32&nbsp;beta, DosLynx supports sending the HTTP
     Referer: Header field in its GET and POST requests.  This is
     described in RFC&nbsp;2616, Hypertext&nbsp;Transfer&nbsp;Protocol
      -- HTTP/1.1, section&nbsp;14.36.  refmode= configuration and a
     new Options|Manage&nbsp;HTTP&nbsp;Referer&nbsp;Mode menu entry or
     command provide for configuring and managing this support.
     By default, sending the Referer: field is disabled or vetoed.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Complete ISO-8859-1 Character Set Support<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.33&nbsp;beta, DosLynx provides complete support for
     the ISO-8859-1 (8-bit) character set.  However, seeing all of the
     ISO-8859-1 characters properly also depends on having your DOS
     system set up to use display and/or printer Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850.
     In many english speaking countries, this isn't the default.
     Refer to the
     <a href="#CodePage850">Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850&nbsp;Cook&nbsp;Book</a>
     section (above), for information on arranging this setup.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>fromname= Configuration Added<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.33&nbsp;beta, DosLynx provides a fromname=
     configuration option.  It accepts "your name in real life", for use
     on the From: line of e-mail that you send.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Limited Support for Five More HTML Tags<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.33&nbsp;beta, DosLynx will handle the
     &lt;BGSOUND&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and &lt;EMBED&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
     tags as additional near synonyms for &lt;IMG&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
     This means that a link will be provided to the resources that those
     tags advertise.  The place holders for these links will be [BGSOUND]
     and [EMBED], when showmetas=NO is configured.  And, [urlfilename],
     otherwise.  Also, &lt;IFRAME&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,
     &lt;ILAYER&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;., and &lt;LAYER&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
     tags will be handled, the way &lt;FRAME&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tags
     have long been handled.  You'll see a Frame: or Layer: label
     followed by a link to the tag's src= specified URL.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>HTTP Cookie(s) Support<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.34&nbsp;beta, DosLynx supports the HTTP Set-Cookie:
     and Cookie: Header fields.  This is described in
     <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html"
     >http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html</a>&nbsp;.
     cookiedir= and cookiemode= configuration and a new
     Options|Manage&nbsp;HTTP&nbsp;Cookie&nbsp;Mode menu entry or
     command provide for configuring and managing this support.
     By default, Cookie(s) Support is disabled or vetoed.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Limited Support for the HTML &lt;DIV . . . Tag<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.34&nbsp;beta, DosLynx supports the
     HTML&nbsp;&lt;DIV&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tag and its align=
     attribute, for settings of left, center, or right.  Support for
     the HTML&nbsp;&lt;P&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tag's same align=
     attribute settings has been added, too.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>smtphost= Configuration Extended to Include Host's
     Port Number<DD>Beginning with version&nbsp;0.34&nbsp;beta, DosLynx
     configuration for your SMTP (mail) Host's address may include the
     port it listens on, if it isn't the well known port 25.
     This enables the DosLynx e-mail client's use with ISP(s) that have
     changed their SMTP server(s) to listen, for e-mail submission(s),
     on TCP/IP port 587.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Limited UTF-8 Character Set Support<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.35&nbsp;beta, DosLynx provides limited support
     for UTF-8 coded documents.  The supported UTF-8 characters and
     character sequences correspond to all of the ISO-8859-1
     characters, together with nine additional characters that aren't
     included in the ISO-8859-1 character set.  Seeing all of the
     ISO-8859-1 characters properly also depends on having your
     DOS system set up to use display and/or printer
     Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850.  In many english speaking countries,
     this isn't the default.  Refer to the
     <a href="#CodePage850">Code&nbsp;Page&nbsp;850&nbsp;Cook&nbsp;Book</a>
     section (above), for information on arranging this setup.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DD>Beginning with version&nbsp;0.38b, 23 more Unicode characters
     (for a total of 32) that aren't included in the ISO-8859-1
     character set will be recognized in UTF-8 coded documents.
     And, as numeric character references, in HTML documents with any
     encoding.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Support for (Anti)Caching Directives<DD>DosLynx&nbsp;v0.35b also
     brings support for the Expires:&nbsp;&lt;datetimestring&gt; and
     Pragma:&nbsp;no-cache HTTP&nbsp;Header fields and corresponding
     HTML &lt;META&nbsp;HTTP-EQUIV=&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tags.
     And, the Cache-Control:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. HTTP Header field.
     Elsewhere, these Header fields and tags are referred-to as
     "(anti)caching&nbsp;directives".
 <DT>&nbsp;<DD>
     This support should improve your experiences with "login" type
     Forms and Cookies-using Web servers.  By insuring that you see
     updated versions of Web pages that get changed in the course of
     your interactions with their Web site(s).  However, if you have
     lower speed Internet service, you may find the document
     refetching this support implies annoying.  If so, you may use
     histmode=ON configuration to defeat the new support.
     See the sample DOSLYNX.CFG file provided for more information
     on this configuration.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>https/SSL/TLS Support Added<DD>The DosLynx&nbsp;v0.38b 32-bit
     Protected&nbsp;Mode variation or version brings support for
     secure sessions, or https URLs, at last!  This is support that
     is required by many servers that provide for Login(s) or
     transfers of sensitive data.
 <DT>&nbsp;<DD>
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b, this support is provided by
     means of an OpenSSL&nbsp;v1.0.2u library provided in the DJGPP tools.
     DosLynx provides each server name to be accessed to its OpenSSL
     client in order to support the SNI function.  As a result, the server
     names being accessed are likely revealed in the SSL/TLS client's
     hello message(s).  DosLynx still does not provide for checking the
     authenticity of server Certificates.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>TLS/SSL Support Added for E-mail Client<DD>The DosLynx&nbsp;v0.39b
     32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode variation or version brings support for
     secure SMTP e-mail sending sessions.  This support may be required
     by SMTP hosts that also require an SMTP&nbsp;AUTH&nbsp;LOGIN.
 <DT>&nbsp;<DD>
     Beginning with DosLynx&nbsp;v0.44b, this support is provided by the
     same OpenSSL&nbsp;v1.0.2u library that provides the https/SSL/TLS
     support in the DosLynx 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode variation or
     version.  DosLynx does not provide the E-mail server's name to its
     OpenSSL client.  So, the SNI function is not supported for E-mail.
     Nor does it provide for checking the authenticity of server
     Certificates.  A new configuration item, smtpsec=, provides a
     choice of two SSL Protocol variations for SMTP.  These are described
     in comments in the sample DOSLYNX.CFG file provided.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>TCPINFO Utility Now Provided with DosLynx<DD>Beginning with
     version&nbsp;0.38b, the Traditional DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode Package
     will include a DosLynx-centric make of the WATTCP TCPINFO.EXE
     utility.  This TCPINFO provides a mostly comment-free view of
     one's WATTCP.CFG or DOSLYNX.CFG file(s) and the result(s) for
     my_ip=BOOTP, my_ip=DHCP, or my_ip=EDHCP configuration.
     This TCPINFO is made with the same WATTCP library used to make
     DosLynx.  So, its result(s) for BOOTP and (E)DHCP may be expected
     to match the result(s) that DosLynx gets.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>WATTCP sock_setbuf( ) Support<DD>Beginning with version&nbsp;0.38b,
     the DosLynx Protected&nbsp;Mode variations or versions will provide
     an optional 24&nbsp;KB TCP assembly buffer when dnldbufs=0 is
     configured.  This lengthened buffer is provided to the DosLynx
     WATTCP component via its sock_setbuf( ) call.  On newer
     (read:&nbsp;faster) PCs with high speed Internet connections, this
     lengthened buffer should greatly improve downloading speed.
     (As this is a double buffer, its memory requirement makes it
     impractical for the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode variation or version.
     However, PCs that are limited to using the DosLynx Real&nbsp;Mode
     version usually aren't fast enough to be able to make use of
     sock_setbuf( ) support, anyway.)
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Support for Hexadecimal Numeric Character References<DD>Beginning
     with version&nbsp;0.38b, DosLynx will support numeric character
     references with decimal or hexadecimal values.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>File|Clip View Menu Entry Added<DD>Beginning with DosLynx v0.41b,
     the File|Clip&nbsp;View command will provide for clipping or
     extracting URL(s) or other relatively short citations from rendered
     document(s).  This command's dialog provides Paste and Save&nbsp;As
     push buttons.  You use the Paste push button to move a URL clipping
     into the File|Open&nbsp;URL... menu entry dialog's history, for use.
     The Save&nbsp;As push button allows you to save a clipping in a
     local (clip board) file.  In turn, saved clipping file(s) may be
     pasted into the e-mail client's TMemo dialog.  Or, into the HTML
     Form TextArea input control's TMemo dialog.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Save&nbsp;As Dialog's Results To Go To File Open Dialogs' History
 <DD>Beginning with DosLynx v0.41b, local file Save&nbsp;As dialog
     results will be added to the local file open dialogs' history
     list.  As well as to the Save&nbsp;As dialogs' own history list.
     This enables reaccessing new local file(s) without having to
     reenter their name(s).
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="RemovedFeatures">Removed DosLynx Features</A></H2>

The following features were removed from DosLynx, starting at
versions&nbsp;0.20b, 0.22b, and 0.26b:<BR>
<DL>
 <DT>Gopher Support<DD>Yep, sorry.  It's been taken out.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Built-in .GIF Viewer<DD>This has been replaced with the swap out and
     call to DLXVIEW described in several places in this document.
     (Use Navigate|Find... and specify DLXVIEW to find those places.)
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Bugs, Crashes, Hangs, and Loops<DD>Most of these have been taken out,
     too.  You may still see some breakout(&nbsp;) calls.  But, each time
     you do, you'll be able to be thankful for not having to reboot DOS
     and redial your ISP!
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>wais Support<DD>Yep, sorry.  This one's gone, too.
 <DT>&nbsp;
 <DT>Local Graphics File Copying<DD>Beginning with version&nbsp;0.26b,
     DosLynx no longer finds it necessary to copy local graphics files
     for the purpose of submitting them to DLXVIEW for viewing.
     This provides a noticeable performance improvement on older
     (read:  slower) PCs.  We trust this copying "feature" won't be
     much missed.

Fred C. Macall, maintaining DosLynx since 2002, gratefully acknowledges
the contributions of its original author, Garrett Arch Blythe.  I am also
grateful to Wayne S. Buttles who worked on DosLynx in 1996 and passed the
baton in SRC_16A.ZIP.  DosLynx now incorporates SWAP.ASM, which you'll see
performs admirably.  It contains the following notice:<BR>
Copyright (C) 1990 by Marty Del Vecchio<p>

The DosLynx 16-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version has been implemented
through use of the Kevin Morgan Software Services Protected&nbsp;Mode
APPlication construction toolkit,
 <A HREF="http://www.zeta.org.au/~grove/tvplus/memory/pmapp.zip">PMAPP.ZIP</A>
.  Kevin's toolkit has provided me with the perfect spring board for my
leap into the real world (or is it, parallel universe?) of
Protected&nbsp;Mode software development!  PMAPP.ZIP  carries the
following notice:<BR>
This distribution copyright (c) 1994, Kevin Morgan.  All rights reserved.<p>

The DosLynx 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version has been implemented
through use of DJGPP&nbsp;v2.05 resources and tools, in DOS!
These include an elegant 2&nbsp;KB "stub loader", the
GNU&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;v8.3.0 compiler, and the UPX&nbsp;v3.02 eXecutable
Packer.  I have supplemented these with the Borland C/C++ resources and
tools, acknowledged above and below, and the MASM&nbsp;v6.11d assembler.<P>

The new 32-bit version's source comes from most of the same DosLynx,
Turbo&nbsp;Vision&nbsp;v2.0, WATTCP, and WWW sources used for making the
other DosLynx versions.  All of these have been dragged into compliance
with the GCC&nbsp;v8.3.0 compiler's and MASM&nbsp;v6.11d assembler's
requirements.  So, about 95&nbsp;percent of the DosLynx source is shared
in common among all three DosLynx versions.  The resulting DOSLYNXS.EXE
is quite a treasure!<P>

I expect that you may obtain all the DJ Delorie resources and tools
including UPX&nbsp;v3.02, as I did, from:<BR>
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/</a><P>

The DosLynx 32-bit Protected&nbsp;Mode version's https/SSL/TLS support has
been implemented by linking DosLynx with the OpenSSL v1.0.2u installation
or library included with the DJGPP tools.  OpenSSL also is available
from:<br>
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a> .<br>
The detailed DosLynx/OpenSSL linkage has been adapted from one of
Mark&nbsp;Mentovai's lynx-ssl patches.  Those used to be available
from:<br>
<a href="http://www.moxienet.com/lynx/">http://www.moxienet.com/lynx/</a> .
<br>
Now, they seem to be gone from there.  However, they may still be found
in mirror site(s) such as:<br>
