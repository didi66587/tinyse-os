#       This is a free form configuration file.
#       Options do not need to be in any specific order.
#       However, the option names and values shown in the comments may be
#       case-sensitive.  (DOS file and path names are not case-sensitive,
#       however.)  Also, note that YES and NO are NOT interchangeable
#       with ON and OFF.  Use whatever the comments call for in each case.
#
#       Comments start with # or ; and end at the end of the line containing
#       them.
#
#       Option form is keyword=value for each parameter.
#       The keyword=value should all be on one line, at the start of a line.
#       Possible values are listed above by each keyword.
#
#       Except where indicated, all options apply for both Real Mode and
#       Protected Mode DosLynx versions.

#       The following are options specific to Waterloo TCP for network
#               configuration:
#       DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT VALUES OF THESE OPTIONS.
#       Never guess IP addresses.  If you are unsure, contact you local
#               network administrator.

#       my_ip           Mandatory option, unless BOOTP is desired.
#
#       my_ip specifies your computer's IP address.  Or, how it may be found.
#       The value may be BOOTP, DHCP, or EDHCP instead of an IP address,
#               in the case that Waterloo TCP can configure itself through
#               your available BOOTP or (E)DHCP server.  DHCP changes made
#               in DosLynx v0.38b proved to be problematic for at least one
#               user.  So, most of those changes were rolled back,
#               in DosLynx v0.39b, for my_ip=DHCP configuration.
#               my_ip=EDHCP (which might be remembered as Extended DHCP)
#               configuration now provides for those who liked all of the
#               version 0.38b DHCP changes.
#       If you specify my_ip=DHCP or my_ip=EDHCP, make sure that mss=
#               specifies 576 or more, or defaults (to 1400).
#       If you specify an IP address, it must be unique.  If you accidentally
#               share an IP address with another computer on the same LAN,
#               chances are neither machine will work right.
#       The default for my_ip is BOOTP.
###my_ip=192.168.1.1
my_ip=BOOTP

#       netmask         Mandatory option, unless BOOTP, DHCP, or EDHCP used.
#
#       netmask is simply your [sub]network mask.  This value should never
#               be 255.255.255.255
#       If you use BOOTP, DHCP, or EDHCP for my_ip, you will not have to use
#               netmask=
#       If you do not leave the following line commented out, use the correct
#               netmask!
###netmask=255.255.255.0

#       gateway         Mandatory option, unless BOOTP, DHCP, or EDHCP used.
#
#       gateway is your local gateway.  This value should be the valid IP
#               address of another locally networked computer or router that
#               provides your gateway to the Internet.
#       If you use BOOTP, DHCP, or EDHCP for my_ip, you will not have to use
#               gateway=
#       An esoteric use of gateway= allows you to configure a routing table
#               with up to twelve separate entries.  Each entry must specify
#               a gateway, an optional destination subnet, and then an
#               optional subnet mask:
#                       gateway=0.0.0.0[, 0.0.0.0[, 0.0.0.0]]
#               You may use the same gateway IP in each entry if need be.
#       If you do not leave the following line commented out, use the correct
#               gateway IP address.
###gateway=192.168.1.100

#       nameserver      Mandatory option, unless BOOTP, DHCP, or EDHCP used.
#
#       nameserver is a networked computer that can tell your computer the IP
#               address of yet another networked computer.  You can have up
#               to nine different nameserver= entries, each assigned a
#               different IP address.  However, the more nameserver= entries
#               you have, the longer it will take to conclude that no IP
#               address is available, if and when that is the case.
#               Also, bad nameserver= entries may slow the look up of even
#               valid names.  Waterloo TCP will go through the list of
#               provided nameservers in order of appearance until a valid IP
#               address is determined.
#       Two or three good entries probably will provide a reasonable
#               compromise between reliability and speed in concluding that
#               no IP address is available.
#       If you use BOOTP, DHCP, or EDHCP for my_ip, you may not have to use
#               nameserver=
#       If you do not leave the following line commented out, use correct
#               nameserver IP address(es)!
###nameserver=192.168.1.100

#       domainslist     Optional.
#
#       domainslist tells Waterloo TCP the name of your domain.
#               Then, while running DosLynx, any computer name(s) specified
#               without a full domain name will have the domainslist= value
#               appended to them.
#       For best results, enclose the value of the domainslist= entry within
#               double quotes.
#       Don't use a domainslist= value that isn't appropriate for your site.
#       There is no default value for domainslist.
###domainslist="mysitesdomain.com"

#       include         Optional.
#
#       include will simply insert another file's contents as if it were
#               inside this configuration file at the line where the include
#               directive resides.
#       Only Waterloo TCP keywords will be recognized in the included file.
#       There is no default value for include.
###include=c:\your_own.cfg

#       bootp           Optional, esoteric.
#
#       bootp will use a specific BOOTP or (E)DHCP server by specifying the
#               server's IP address.  You use bootp= to specify either a
#               BOOTP or (E)DHCP server's IP address.
#               (dhcp= won't be recognized.)
#       If you are not using BOOTP, DHCP, nor EDHCP or have no need to
#               exactly specify the IP address of your BOOTP or (E)DHCP
#               server, there will be no need to use the bootp= keyword.
###bootp=0.0.0.0

#       bootpto         Optional.
#
#       bootpto specifies the amount of time that Waterloo TCP will wait for
#               your BOOTP or (E)DHCP server to respond with your network
#               configuration information.
#       The default timeout value is 30 seconds.
bootpto=30

#       ethip           Optional, esoteric.
#
#       ethip is used to allow use of multiple IP addresses within the same
#               configuration file with each one being tied to a particular
#               ethernet address.
#       This is mainly for use of one big configuration file residing on a
#               network that every user can use.
###ethip=00:00:00:00:00:00, 0.0.0.0

#       hostname        Optional.
#
#       hostname allows you to give your computer a name while DosLynx is
#               running.  Remote computers may recognize you by this host
#               name.
#       Do not use another computer's name as your host name.
#       Do not append the domain to the host name.  That will be done for you
#               by appending the entry specified by the domainslist keyword.
#       If used, BOOTP, DHCP, and EDHCP may provide a host name for you.
hostname=mydosbox

#       sockdelay       Optional.
#
#       sockdelay allows you to specify a specific number of seconds that
#               Waterloo TCP will attempt to connect to a remote computer,
#               wait for data from a remote computer, and wait to accomplish
#               other miscellaneous networking tasks.
#       Don't get carried away with this value.  DosLynx will (still) have to
#               wait the full sockdelay= time to recognize some hopeless
#               situations.  Even where those becomes obvious to you in about
#               ten or fifteen seconds!  An exception to this rule comes when
#               receiving long files from certain servers.  On occasion, they
#               may let your session go idle for five minutes or more!
#               So, for working with them, a sockdelay setting as long as
#               600 to 900 seconds may be necessary and appropriate.
#       The default for sockdelay is 30 seconds.
###sockdelay=40

#       mss             Optional.
#
#       mss is the maximum packet segment size that Waterloo TCP can receive.
#       The default value (ETH_MSS) is 1400.
#       The maximum value specified should not exceed 1500.
#
#       We no longer recommend the use of an mss= value less than 576 .
###mss=576
mss=1500

#       The remaining options are specific to DosLynx
#       (both Real Mode and Protected Mode versions, except where indicated):

#       tempdir         Optional, but suggested.
#
#       tempdir specifies the path to a directory in which all temporary
#               files DosLynx will create will be written.
#       It is a good idea not to specify a network drive, as that will cause
#               a drastic performance decrease.
#       If you do not specify tempdir=, the current working directory
#               probably will be used.  However, a TMP= Environment setting
#               probably will override even the value specified here.
#       Be sure to append a backslash after the path!
###tempdir=c:\win95\temp\
tempdir=c:\temp\

#       textmode        Optional.
#
#       textmode will suggest a video mode for DosLynx to use instead of the
#               normal 80x25 screen size.
#       The default textmode is LOW.
#       Possible values are LOW (80x25) and HIGH (80x50 or 80x43).
textmode=LOW

#       contrast        Optional.
#
#       contrast may be used to change the attribute table that DosLynx uses
#               for its document display windows.  contrast has no effect on
#               the Turbo Vision dialog windows used by DosLynx.
#
#       DosLynx has one attribute table intended for color displays and,
#               since version 0.29b, three attribute tables intended for
#               various monochrome display arrangements.  By default,
#               DosLynx attempts to automatically select the attribute table
#               best suited to your video adapter and display.  However,
#               the automatic selection isn't always the best one possible.
#               This is especially likely to be an issue in systems using a
#               monochrome display.
#       You may tweak or modify the automatic selection by specifying a
#               contrast setting of A, B, or C.  In combination with the
#               default setting of D, these contrast settings provide for
#               selecting any one of the four available attribute tables.
#
#       We suggest that you start with contrast omitted or specifying D.
#               Then, after you have finalized your system's available
#               display settings for best results with your other software,
#               evaluate DosLynx's presentation of a document such as
#               INFO.HTM.  Are ordinary text, link text, the selected link,
#               and text identified by the Navigate|Find... menu entry or
#               command all distinguishable?  If not, try each of the three
#               non-default contrast settings to find the best result.
#
#       The default value for contrast is D.
#       Possible values are A, B, C, and D.
###contrast=B

#       printer         Optional.
#
#       printer tells DosLynx what DOS device that your printer is connected
#               to.
#       NUL is the default value, which means you have no printer.
#       Values can be any valid DOS device such as LPT1, PRN, AUX, COM4, etc.
printer=LPT1

#       histmode        Optional.
#
#       Beginning with DosLynx version 0.35b, histmode configuration tells
#               DosLynx whether to ignore or honor certain (anti)caching
#               directives.  These directives may be found in HTML documents
#               or in accompanying HTTP response Headers from their servers.
#               Configuring histmode=ON specifies that DosLynx continues to
#               ignore these directives, as it has in all its previous 
#               versions.  By default, histmode=OFF specifying that DosLynx
#               honors the (anti)caching directives.
#       Documents received via TCP/IP which include or are accompanied by
#               honored (anti)caching directive(s) get freed or discarded as
#               soon as they become unviewed.  So, returning to such a
#               document after following any of its link(s) necessitates
#               refetching it from its original source.  That discarding and
#               refetching pretty much protects against viewing any stale
#               document(s).  And, it may be seen as leaving more room in
#               memory for other document(s) that aren't likely to change.
#               Bulletin board and Forum index pages provide examples of
#               frequently updated documents that are likely to be furnished
#               with (anti)caching directive(s).
#       In contrast, with histmode=ON configuration every loaded document
#               (with the exception of local file copies) gets kept or
#               cached, occupying some DosLynx memory, as long as memory
#               remains for it.  Or, until the following loaded=
#               configuration option's specified number of additional
#               documents displace it.  This tends to save on TCP/IP
#               document fetches.  But, increases the chances for viewing
#               stale rendition(s) of frequently updated document(s).
#       histmode=AUTO is a third possible configuration.  This specifies
#               that (anti)caching directives are to be honored whenever
#               HTTP Cookie Mode is (Enabled and) ON.
#               And, that (anti)caching directives are to be ignored when
#               HTTP Cookie Mode isn't ON.  You may find this configuration
#               useful if you have lower speed Internet access and tend to
#               make some use of the Options|Manage HTTP Cookie Mode menu
#               entry or command.  It will help protect against viewing
#               stale document(s) when that may be most valuable.
#       The default value for histmode is OFF.
#       Possible values are OFF, AUTO, and ON.
###histmode=ON

#       loaded          Optional.
#
#       loaded will tell DosLynx how many accessed files it should try to
#               keep in memory.  Once this limit is reached, DosLynx will
#               begin freeing the oldest file, which isn't on view, each
#               time it loads another file.  This helps with keeping free
#               memory readily available for each new file load.
#       loaded is honored in the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.  However,
#               the default value ought to be fine for those versions.
#       The default is 10.  Possible values are 1 through 10.
loaded=10

#       home            Optional.
#
#       home specifies a URL that will be loaded by DosLynx on startup.
#       If you do not want home to be loaded on startup, use the loadhome=
#               keyword or do not specify home= at all.
###home=http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/kufacts_start.html
home=file:///./info.htm

#       loadhome        Optional.
#
#       loadhome tells DosLynx whether or not to load the URL specified by
#               the home= keyword on startup.
#       The default value for loadhome is ON.
#       Possible values are OFF and ON.
loadhome=ON

#       debugen         Optional.

#       debugen enables heapcheck(ing) while DosLynx shuts down.  
#               heapcheck( ) discovers heap corruption resulting from certain
#               kinds of software errors.  Setting debugen=ON may help to
#               avoid crashing during shut-down.  However, it is a luxury
#               that probably isn't affordable on slower PCs.  (Shut-down can
#               take as long as 45 minutes on a PC-XT with debugen=ON!)
#       Beginning with DosLynx v0.24b, debugen= also enables a detail trace
#               of FTP accesses or mini-sessions.  Each FTP command sent is
#               listed in the messages window, together with a line reporting
#               the FTP server's response.  This trace is intended to help
#               you find out what is going wrong, if and when an FTP access
#               fails repeatedly.
#       The default value for debugen is OFF.
#       Possible values are OFF and ON.
###debugen=ON

#       hotlistfile     Optional.
#
#       hotlistfile specifies an HTML file where you can store URLs as
#               "book marks" for quick access.
#       hotlistfile can be any valid DOS path with the following exception:
#               The file extension (suffix) should be .HTM
#       hotlistfile is like any other HTML file and you may, of course, edit
#               the file outside of DosLynx to your specifications.
#               You'll have to use an external editor to get rid of entries
#               that you want to remove.
#       If you do not specify a hotlistfile, there is no default and the
#               option to access this file is not available while running
#               DosLynx.
#       If you will be running DosLynx in a directory other than the one
#               you installed DosLynx in, be sure and specify the full DOS
#               path to your hotlist file.
###hotlistfile=HOTLIST.HTM
hotlistfile=D:\DOSINET\HOTLIST.HTM

#       errorhtml       Mandatory.
#
#       errorhtml is an HTML file that will be loaded when DosLynx is unable
#               to access any URL.
#       The file specified must have the .HTM extension (suffix) and must
#               reside in the configuration file directory specified with
#               the /p command line option or in the working directory from
#               which you executed the DosLynx command.
#       errorhtml is like any other HTML file and you may, of course, edit
#               the file outside of DosLynx to your specifications.
#       If errorhtml is not specified, the default name of ERROR.HTM is used.
#       If the errorhtml file does not exist, DosLynx might hang.
errorhtml=ERROR.HTM

#       fromname        Optional.
#
#       Beginning with DosLynx version 0.33b, fromname specifies the user's
#               "name in real life", for use on the From: line of e-mail(s)
#               being sent.
#       If you leave fromname unconfigured, DosLynx will try to use its
#               current IP address, instead.
#       It won't hurt to enclose this value in quotes.
###fromname="Jane L. Smith"

#       mailaddr        Optional.
#
#       mailaddr specifies the Internet mail address where you receive mail.
#       mailaddr is needed for sending mail to the developer of DosLynx
#               as well as any mailto: addresses.
#       Possible values can be any valid Internet mail address.
###mailaddr=mymailid@mymaildomain.com

#       networked       Optional.
#
#       networked allows you to turn off network access in the case that you
#               are not connected to the Internet, or in the case that you
#               only want to use DosLynx for local file access.
#       Users not connected to the Internet should use NO to avoid problems
#               that may arise.
#       If you are connected to the Internet through SLIP, PPP, etc. then
#               you should set networked to YES.
#       The default value is YES.
#       Possible values are YES and NO.
networked=YES

#       cookiedir       Optional.
#
#       cookiedir specifies the path to a directory where any and all
#               DosLynx cookie files will be maintained.  These files
#               will be needed for non-persistent or session cookies,
#               as well as for persistent cookies.  DosLynx cookie files
#               will be given names based on Internet domain names.
#               Such as:  google.com .  As these names don't follow the
#               usual DOS naming conventions, we recommend that you
#               specify a directory to be used exclusively for DosLynx
#               cookies.
#
#       There is no default for cookiedir.  If you do not specify it,
#               the only support available for cookies will be a
#               Monitor mode for reporting incoming cookie offerings.
#       Be sure to specify a path ending with a backslash.
###cookiedir=D:\DOSINET\COOKIES\

#       cookiemode      Optional.
#
#       cookiemode allows you to specify whether DosLynx will support
#               HTTP cookies.  This support is described in:
#               http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html .
#               Cookies provide a valuable facility for implementing
#               "stateful sessions" conducted between Web servers and
#               clients (browsers).  However, the privacy and security
#               concerns sketched below, for refmode, go double or
#               triple for cookies.  Also, as is the case with refmode,
#               HTTP servers designed to use cookies may not honor
#               requests from browsers that don't support cookies.
#               To get your way with these servers, you may have to
#               compromise or relax your privacy and security interest(s)
#               by enabling DosLynx to support cookies.
#       Beginning with DosLynx v0.34b, cookies support is controlled by
#               a three level arrangement.  Each level has a veto over
#               the support of cookies.  cookiedir= configuration,
#               described in the section just above, provides the first
#               level of control.  Without cookiedir= configuration,
#               DosLynx cookies support is limited to the Monitor mode
#               described just below, for cookiemode=AUDIT configuration.
#               cookiemode= configuration provides the second level of
#               control.
#
#       By default, DosLynx support of cookies is disabled or vetoed.
#
#       A new Options|Manage HTTP Cookie Mode menu entry or command
#               provides the third level of control, or management.
#               This menu entry or command reports on the status of
#               your combined cookiedir= and cookiemode= configuration,
#               if any.  And, if enabled by cookiedir= and cookiemode=
#               configuration, the status of the third level management
#               control.  If enabled here, this menu entry or control
#               also provides a push button for stepping through the
#               management control's two or three potential modes or
#               settings.
#
#       Values for cookiemode= configuration are as follows:
#               cookiemode=
#               Value        Effect on Cookies Support
#               ===========  ==============================================

#                            hand, are not sent back in Request Headers.
#                            (Same as default.)
#               ENABLE       Cookies support may be controlled by the
#                            Options|Manage HTTP Cookie Mode menu entry,
#                            if cookiedir= is also configured.
#                            The management control is initially set of OFF.
#               AUDIT        With cookiedir= configured, the same as ENABLE
#                            with the addition that any cookie(s) activity
#                            gets reported to the Messages window in
#                            audit:  Set-Cookie: . . . and
#                            audit:  Cookie: . . . messages.
#
#                            audit:  Set-Cookie: . . . messages represent
#                            cookie(s) being received in
#                            HTTP Response Headers.
#                            audit:  Cookie: . . . messages represent
#                            cookie(s) being sent in HTTP Request Headers.
#
#                            Even without cookiedir= configured, AUDIT
#                            enables a Monitor mode which also uses
#                            audit:  Set-Cookie: . . . messages to report on
#                            received cookie(s).  After being reported in
#                            Monitor mode, received cookie(s) are discarded.
#               ON           Same as ENABLE, except that the
#                            Options|Manage HTTP Cookie Mode menu entry
#                            control's initial setting is ON, if cookiedir=
#                            is also configured.
###cookiemode=AUDIT

#       refmode         Optional.
#
#       refmode allows you to enable sending the HTTP Header Referer: field
#               in DosLynx GET and POST requests.  This is described in
#               RFC 2616, Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1,
#               section 14.36.  The Referer: field reports the URL of the
#               document containing the link being requested.  So, to a
#               certain extent, it confirms or reveals what it is that you
#               are reading.  Unfortunately, a few HTTP servers won't honor
#               requests that don't include a satisfactory Referer: field.
#               To get your way with those servers, you may have to
#               compromise or relax your security interest(s), to a certain
#               extent.  (No Referer: field is ever provided in request(s)
#               initiated via the File|Open URL... (F3) menu entry or
#               command.)
#       Beginning with DosLynx v0.32b, Referer: field sending is controlled
#               by a two level arrangement.  Both levels have a veto over
#               sending the Referer: field.  refmode= configuration
#               provides the first level of control.
#
#       By default, sending the Referer: field is disabled or vetoed.
#
#       A new Options|Manage HTTP Referer Mode menu entry or command
#               provides the second level of control, or management.
#               This menu entry or command reports on the status of your
#               refmode= configuration, if any.  And, if enabled here, the
#               status of the second level or management control.
#               If enabled here, this menu entry or command also provides
#               a push button for toggling the management control's mode
#               or setting.
#
#       Values for refmode= configuration are as follows:
#               refmode=
#               Value     Effect on Request Headers
#               ========  =================================================
#               DISABLE   Referer: field is never sent.  (Same as default.)
#               ENABLE    Referer: field sending may be controlled by the
#                         Options|Manage HTTP Referer Mode menu entry.
#                         That control is initially set to OFF.
#               AUDIT     Same as ENABLE, with the addition that any
#                         Referer: field sent gets reported to the Messages
#                         window, in an audit:  Referer: . . . message.
#               ON        Same as ENABLE, except that the
#                         Options|Manage HTTP Referer Mode menu entry
#                         control's initial setting is ON.
###refmode=AUDIT

#       shoswap         Optional.
#                       Ignored by the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.
#
#       shoswap allows you to disable swapping DosLynx out of memory when
#               you shell-out to DOS.  This provision is mostly for debug
#               purposes.  It also might be used to prevent the DosLynx
#               swapper from using XMS or disk space upon a shell-out to DOS.
#               (Beginning with DosLynx v0.24b, the swapmem= configuration
#               option, below, provides for directly limiting the DosLynx
#               swapper's use of EMS and XMS memory.)
#       shoswap has no effect on swapping DosLynx out of memory to run
#               DLXVIEW for graphic viewing, however.
#       While DosLynx is swapped-out of memory, most of the standard DOS
#               memory is available for commands or programs.  However, you
#               must refrain from loading a TSR or using the Packet Driver.
#               (Though, you may be able to use another Packet Driver
#               instance if you have already installed a Packet Mux..)
#               If DosLynx is configured to use EMS for overlays, you also
#               must avoid disrupting its EMS setup while it is swapped-out
#               of memory.
#       The default value is YES, to enable shell-out swapping, for all
#               three DosLynx versions.
#       Possible values are YES and NO.
###shoswap=NO

#       nntphost        Optional.
#
#       nntphost is used to specify the host server from which DosLynx
#               will read Usenet News.
#       It will be to your advantage to specify a local, or your ISP's
#               provided, NNTP host.
#       Possible values are any valid NNTP Internet host that will serve you.
nntphost=news.mysitesdomain.com

#       b64usrid and b64passw   Optional.
#
#       These provide <base64 encoded userID> and <base64 encoded password>
#               data for optional SMTP AUTH LOGIN authentication.  This may
#               be required, by your SMTP Host, for relaying mail that you
#               wish to send.
#
#       Beginning with DosLynx version 0.31b, these values may be omitted
#               or provided with the following results, when you attempt to
#               send mail:
#       b64usrid     b64passw     Result
#       ========     ========     ======
#       omitted      omitted      SMTP AUTH LOGIN is not attempted.
#       omitted      provided     SMTP AUTH LOGIN is not attempted.
#       provided     omitted      SMTP AUTH LOGIN is attempted if b64passw
#                                   data is supplied via the command line
#                                   /S option.
#       provided     provided     SMTP AUTH LOGIN is always attempted.
#
#       As attempting an SMTP AUTH LOGIN implys the use of an ESMTP
#               connection (EHLO is sent to connect), one or both of these
#               values must be omitted for working with an SMTP host that
#               does not support ESMTP.  (That is, an SMTP host that still
#               requires a connection starting with HELO.)
#
#       For instructions for one way of encoding the data values, to be
#               supplied for b64usrid and b64passw, see:
#               Base64-Encoding
#               in:
#               http://macall.net/PMSMTP.TXT
#       Another way of encoding b64usrid and b64passw is outlined in the
#       DosLynx README document, in the Configuring DosLynx section.
#
#       Shown here:
#               b64usrid data for fmacall

b64usrid="Zm1hY2FsbA=="
###b64passw=

#       smtphost        Optional.
#
#       smtphost is used to specify the SMTP host server that DosLynx will
#               relay mail through.  Beginning with DosLynx version 0.34b,
#               the TCP/IP port number that the SMTP host listens on also
#               may be specified.
#       It will be to your advantage to specify a local, or your ISP's
#               provided, SMTP host.
#       If your SMTP host listens on a TCP/IP port number other than the
#               well known port 25 (such as port 587), you specify that
#               by adding :portnumber to the end of the host's name or
#               IP address.
#       Without smtphost configured, you cannot send mailto(s) or send mail
#               to the developer.
#       Possible values are any valid SMTP Internet host that will serve you.

#       smtpsec         Optional.
#                       Ignored by the DosLynx 16-bit versions.
#
#       smtpsec is used to specify an encryption or security method to be
#               used when sending e-mail.  This security won't keep your
#               e-mail secret.  Because, your e-mail is likely to be
#               relayed without encryption before reaching its final
#               destination.  And, of course, it is always subject to
#               being revealed by its recipient(s).  Nor will these
#               arrangements prevent a "man in the middle" intrusion.
#               Because, DosLynxS does not check the SMTP host's
#               certificate.  However, it does keep your e-mail
#               AUTH LOGIN b64usrid and b64passw credentials from being
#               exchanged in clear text.
#       The available security methods are only provided by the DosLynx
#               32-bit Protected Mode version (DosLynxS), beginning with
#               version 0.39b.  The DosLynx 16-bit versions and all
#               previous 32-bit versions ignore any smtpsec= configuration.
#       Often, smtpsec configuration will have to be closely coordinated
#               with the requirements of your SMTP host.  And, with any
#               port number specified in your smtphost= configuration.
#               For example, Gmail requires smtpsec=STARTTLS configuration
#               when port 587 is specified.  Or, smtpsec=LegacySSL
#               configuration when port 465 is specified.
#       Values for smtpsec= configuration are as follows:

#               None        e-mail is sent as clear text.
#                           (Same as default.  This is the only method
#                           available for the DosLynx 16-bit versions.)
#               LegacySSL   e-mail transmission is encrypted using the
#                           SSL Protocol defined by Netscape, beginning
#                           in 1995.  Often, this security method is used
#                           with the SMTP host's port 465.
#               STARTTLS    e-mail transmission is encrypted using the
#                           TLS/SSL Protocol defined in RFCs 2487 and 3207,
#                           beginning in 1999.  Often, this security method
#                           is used with the SMTP host's port 587.

#       http_proxy      Optional.
#
#       http_proxy tells DosLynx to reroute its request for an http URL to
#               a proxy server rather than going directly to the specified
#               host.
#       This allows users behind a proxy firewall access to the rest of the
#               Internet.
#       Specify a proxy entry just like you would an http URL.  Be sure to
#               specify the correct port number in the proxy URL.
#               For example
#                       http_proxy=http://example.proxy.host:80/
#       There is no default value.  If http_proxy= is not specified,
#               DosLynx will check for a WWW_http_GATEWAY Environment
#               variable setting.  If that is unspecified, no proxy server
#               will be used.
###http_proxy=http://proxy.mydomain.com:8080/

#       ftp_proxy       Optional.
#
#       ftp_proxy tells DosLynx to reroute its request for an ftp URL to
#               a proxy server rather than going directly to the specified
#               host.
#       This allows users behind a proxy firewall access to the rest of the
#               Internet.
#       Specify a proxy entry just like you would an ftp URL.  Be sure to
#               specify the correct port number in the proxy URL.
#               For example
#                       ftp_proxy=ftp://example.proxy.host:21/
#       There is no default value.  If ftp_proxy= is not specified,
#               DosLynx will check for a WWW_ftp_GATEWAY Environment
#               variable setting.  If that is unspecified, no proxy server
#               will be used.

#       showmetas       Optional.
#
#       showmetas tells DosLynx whether to display the three kinds of HTML
#               document content listed below.  These three kinds of content
#               are all of a type which might be deemed "meta" content.
#               That is, content that describes the HTML document and its
#               resources.  Or, non-english content (i.e.:  key word list(s)
#               or file names) pertaining to the document's subject.
#
#       showmetas pertains to the following three kinds of document content:
#
#       1.      HTML <META . . . tags containing CONTENT=, HTTP-EQUIV=, or
#               NAME= attribute value(s).  When showmetas enables this
#               content's presentation, it is not taken literally from the
#               HTML document.  Rather, it is reconstituted from the
#               attribute value(s) obtained while parsing the document.
#               HTML <META HTTP-EQUIV=refresh CONTENT= . . . tag content is
#               always presented, whatever the setting configured for
#               showmetas, in order to provide the refresh linkage this kind
#               of meta usually carrys.
#
#       2.      File names from HREF= . . . attribute values in HTML
#               <A . . . , <IMAGE . . . , <IMG . . . , and
#               <INPUT TYPE=image . . . tags, when ALT= attribute value
#               content isn't provided in references to images.
#               When showmetas enables their presentation, these file names
#               are presented as anchors within square brackets.
#               [ANCHOR] and [IMAGE] placeholders are still provided for
#               these anchors when showmetas doesn't enable metas detail.
#               Beginning with DosLynx version 0.33b, showmetas=
#               configuration also effects the presentation of
#               <BGSOUND . . . and <EMBED . . . tags.  As for images,
#               showmetas selects the presentation of actual link file names
#               or [BGSOUND] and [EMBED], as placeholders, for these tags.
#
#       3.      Any non-HTML content found enclosed within script(s).
#               That is, script(s) content not enclosed within HTML comment
#               nor other HTML tag delimiters.  When showmetas enables its
#               presentation, this content does come more or less literally
#               from the document.  However, as usual in HTML, it's only
#               what's left behind by the HTML parser after it has extracted
#               everything it recognizes.
#
#       If the presentation above is too thick, try showmetas both ways to
#               see which level of document presentation detail you prefer!
#       The default value is YES, to enable the meta content's presentation.
#       Possible values are YES and NO.
###showmetas=NO

#       mouse           Optional.
#
#       mouse tells the DosLynx mouse support modules whether or not
#               a mouse is to be supported.  mouse= options provide possibly
#               separate configuration for the DosLynx Real Mode and
#               Protected Mode versions.
#
#       By default, all three DosLynx versions will try to identify and use
#               any mouse driver installed into your PC's INT 033h Vector.
#               For one reason or another, the installed mouse driver may
#               prove to be problematic in some installations.  This is most
#               likely to show up as DosLynx mis-behavior as soon as the
#               mouse is moved for the first time, in a DosLynx session.
#               Such a problem may be more likely in Protected Mode than in
#               Real Mode.
#       As all DosLynx operations may be performed via the keyboard, without
#               using the mouse, a bypass for a mouse driver problem is to
#               disable mouse support.  This may be accomplished, by means
#               of mouse= configuration, for the DosLynx Real Mode or
#               Protected Mode versions, or all three.
#
#       One of the following values may be specified for mouse=
#              mouse=           Resulting Mouse Support by Version
#              Value            Real Mode  Protected Mode

###mouse=Real

#       swapmem         Optional.
#
#       swapmem tells the DosLynx SWAP module whether or not XMS and/or EMS
#               memory may be used for swapping DosLynx out of DOS memory.
#
#       By default, the DosLynx SWAP module will first try XMS memory, then
#               EMS memory, and finally, disk for swapping.  For one reason
#               or another, the SWAP module's attempts to use XMS or EMS
#               memory may prove to be problematic in some installations.
#               The SWAP module's attempts to use EMS memory are extra
#               likely to prove problematic when ems=YES is configured, to
#               allow the use of EMS memory for holding overlays.
#               To avoid these kinds of problem(s), swapmem= configuration
#               may be used to suppress the SWAP module's use of XMS and/or
#               EMS memory.
#
#       One of the following values may be specified for swapmem=
#              swapmem=
#              Value            SWAP Module's Resource Candidate(s)
#              ========         =======================================
#              Both             XMS, EMS, and disk.  (Same as default.)
#              EMS              EMS and disk.
#              Neither          Disk.
#              XMS              XMS and disk.  (DosLynx v0.20b's Candidates.) 
swapmem=XMS

#       dnldbufs        Optional.
#
#       Beginning with DosLynx version 0.36b, DosLynx may augment its
#               download transfer buffer with additional buffer(s)
#               temporarily allocated in "heap memory".  The term download
#               is used here to refer to all DosLynx operations that result
#               in writing a received object into a local file, named in an
#               explicit local filename dialog.  The use of heap memory,
#               in a download, is intended to extend the time between the
#               download's disk write operations, in the interests of
#               improving downloading speed.  However, as the time between
#               disk writes increases, the time required to perform each
#               disk write also slowly increases.  At some point, the time
#               required for a disk write may reach a length which forces
#               a TCP/IP timeout, aborting the download.
#               dnldbufs= configuration provides for moderating the new
#               buffering behavior, in order to avert such forced TCP/IP
#               timeout(s).
#       Beginning with DosLynx v0.38b, a special dnldbufs=0 configuration
#               case designates a lengthened TCP/IP received packets
#               assembly buffer, for the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.
#               This is a 24 KB buffer specified to the WATTCP kernel by
#               means of its sock_setbuf( ) call.  This configuration can
#               yield greatly improved downloading speed on newer
#               (read:  faster) PCs, with high speed Internet service.
#               The DosLynx Real Mode version's limited memory makes
#               lengthening the TCP/IP received packets assembly buffer
#               impractical, for it.  So, for the Real Mode version,
#               dnldbufs=0 configuration works just like dnldbufs=1
#               configuration.  (Normally, this won't be a big loss.
#               Because, PCs which are limited to running the DosLynx
#               Real Mode version aren't expected to be fast enough to be
#               able to make use of dnldbufs=0 configuration.)
#
#       Non-zero dnldbufs configuration expresses the maximum number of
#               additional buffer(s) to be used in terms of a percentage
#               between about 1 and 500 (percent).  Where 100 (percent)
#               represents the default.  The default has been chosen to
#               avoid TCP/IP timeout(s) with fixed disks up to about
#               fifteen years old.  However, TCP/IP timeout(s) may still
#               be experienced with older (read:  slower) fixed disks and
#               removable media (diskette) devices.  If so, configuring
#               dnldbufs to a value sufficiently below 100 should bring
#               relief. If in doubt, you may as well start with dnldbufs=1 .
#       On the other hand, configuring dnldbufs to a value above 100 may
#               help improve download speed, where the DosLynx 16-bit
#               Protected Mode version is being used with newer
#               (read:  faster) disk(s).  dnldbufs values above
#               100 (percent) will have little effect, over the default,
#               on the DosLynx Real Mode and 32-bit Protected Mode versions.
#       dnldbufs=0 configuration may provide the fastest downloads, where
#               the DosLynx Protected Mode versions are being used with a
#               newer (read:  faster) PC and disk and high speed Internet
#               service.  However, as dnldbufs=0 configuration can be
#               detrimental on PCs which aren't fast enough for it, one
#               should approach its use cautiously.
#
#       The default value for dnldbufs is 100 (percent).
#       Useful values are between 0 and 500 (percent).
#       As explained above, 0 designates a special case for the DosLynx
#               Protected Mode versions.

#       ems             Optional.
#                       Ignored by the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.
#
#       ems allows the DosLynx Real Mode version to utilize EMS memory for
#               holding overlay modules which, otherwise, would have to be
#               read over and over from disk.
#       If you have EMS memory, it will be to your advantage to enable this
#               keyword since it will increase the speed of DosLynx.
#       The DosLynx Protected Mode versions don't attempt to use any EMS
#               memory, except as allowed by the swapmem= option.
#       This value has no effect on the SWAP module's possible use of EMS.
#       The default value is NO.
#       Possible values are YES and NO.

#       emspages        Optional, esoteric.
#                       Ignored by the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.
#
#       emspages tells the DosLynx Real Mode version the maximum number of
#               EMS pages to use when the ems keyword has a value of YES.
#       This allows you to limit the amount of EMS memory DosLynx will
#               attempt to utilize.
#       An EMS page is 16 KB in size.
#       The default value is 0, in which case the DosLynx Real Mode
#               version will use as many EMS pages as it needs.
#               The DosLynx v0.43b Real Mode version will use up to 20 EMS
#               pages, if it finds them available.  As explained above,
#               the DosLynx Protected Mode versions don't use EMS memory,
#               except as allowed by the swapmem= option.
#       Possible values are unsigned short integers in base 10 or base 16
#               format.

#       xms             Optional.
#                       Ignored by the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.
#
#       xms allows the DosLynx Real Mode version to utilize XMS memory for
#               holding overlay modules which, otherwise, would have to be
#               read over and over from disk.  The DosLynx Protected Mode
#               versions use XMS memory for almost all of their code and
#               data, without regard for the xms= configuration value.
#       XMS memory is a computer's addressable memory above 1 megabyte.
#       In the event that you have specified both the ems= and xms=
#               keywords as yes, the DosLynx Real Mode version may attempt
#               to use them both.
#       If you have XMS memory, it will be to your advantage to enable this
#               keyword since it will increase the speed of DosLynx.
#       The DosLynx v0.43b 16-bit Protected Mode version expects to be able
#               to allocate upto about 3.3 MB of XMS memory by means of
#               requests to the DPMI service.  The DosLynx v0.43b 32-bit
#               Protected Mode version expects to be able to allocate upto
#               about 4.0 MB of XMS memory by means of requests to the DPMI
#               service.  There is no configuration option for these
#               expectations.  However, the DosLynx Protected Mode versions
#               are able to run when the available XMS memory is only
#               sufficient to cover somewhat less than the full
#               requirement(s) stated just above.  In such cases, the
#               Protected Mode versions will have less than their usual
#               amount(s) of memory available for data.
#       This value has no effect on the DosLynx SWAP module's possible use
#       of XMS.
#       The default value is NO.
#       Possible values are YES and NO.
xms=NO

#       xmslength       Optional, esoteric.
#                       Ignored by the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.
#
#       xmslength tells the DosLynx Real Mode version the maximum number
#               of extended memory bytes to use when the xms keyword has
#               a value of YES.
#       This allows you to limit the amount of XMS memory the DosLynx
#               Real Mode version will attempt to utilize.
#       The default value is 0, in which case DosLynx will use as much
#               extended memory as it needs.  The DosLynx v0.43b Real Mode
#               version will use up to about 320 KB of XMS if finds no EMS
#               available.  As explained above, the DosLynx v0.43b 16-bit
#               Protected Mode version uses upto about 3.3 MB of XMS
#               memory.  And, the DosLynx v0.43b 32-bit Protected Mode
#               version uses upto about 4.0 MB of XMS memory.
#               These requirements are without regard for any configuration
#               here.

#                       Ignored by the DosLynx Protected Mode versions.
#
#       xmsstart tells the DosLynx Real Mode version the starting address
#               where it can begin to utilize extended memory.
#       This allows you to tell DosLynx not to use specific portions of XMS
#               memory in case another program is already using the memory.
#       The default value is 0, in which case DosLynx will attempt to
#               determine a safe starting address for XMS memory usage.
